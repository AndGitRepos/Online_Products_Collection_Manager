The first I was easily able to use a hammer and screw driver to pop out. But the second was more difficult. I had to lock the metal frame piece into a vice, and using a metal chisel, carefully knock the piece out. It took about 20 minutes, but I got it done.\r\n\r\n3-4 hours later and the trampoline was constructed and on Christmas day, the kid loved it.\r\n\r\nBut this isn't a review written by the kid, it's a review written by the purchaser and builder.\r\n\r\nSo, in an effort to balance out the rating, i'm giving this 1 star.

However, most of the load bearing parts were joined using nuts and bolts so feel trampoline is safe to use', 'Very fast delivery. Great trampoline. It’s quite heavy weight too. The legs are very stiff to push together so use WD40. It’s definitely a 2 person job. There are lots of great videos online with helpful tips.

Great sturdy material and appears fairly weather proof. Easy to collapse down on windy days when we are away for a while. Good price for a great product! Would highly recommend', 'My grandkids love this trampoline. It arrived in 2 boxes which would fit in most hatchbacks. When we unboxed we found the parts check list and started checking. All the parts of the trampoline were there but no other paperwork. I phoned the manufacturer who emailed them through to me. All 30 odd pages, which I printed. The person on the phone told me ""not to worry about the missing safety warning sheet"" Hmmm\r\nAnyway. Two of us built the trampoline. It took a couple of hours. It did take a bit of muscle to pull all the springs on with the supplied tool. And it takes two people to raise the safety net into position. \r\nThe trampoline when fully built weighs about 45kg.  \r\nIt was placed on our lawn.  \r\nIt\'s been fairly windy this month (June) but even so I was shocked when the trampoline was blown over onto it\'s side.  If this happens in summer it certainly wouldn\'t stay upright in very windy conditions. So an anchorage kit is probably a good idea.  \r\nFortunately the top and netting folds down flat onto the trampoline.  It\'s easy to do and the instructions tell you how. Argos also has a video to show you.  We have folded the top down and bought a cover for it. \r\nYou can purchase a cover from the manufacturer for £15  and most spare parts too.\r\nWhen it tipped over one of the plastic holders which fit to hold the top ring in place broke and I found replacements easily online by using a search engine. The manufacturer had them as out of stock at the time.\r\nSo despite our initial problems we have found the trampoline sturdy with plenty but not too much bounce for our young grandchildren. The netting is strong and all the springs are outside of the safety net for added safety.  There is a well padded mat over the springs so they can get in and out safely.\r\nSo happy children who should get years of enjoyment from  fun and exercise', 'Bought on sale was good value.

Not easy to erect and the netting is still not perfect.', ""Really good trampoline, seems to be great quality as I get to jump on it together with my son regularly and it hasn't collapsed yet. Be warned on the assembly, it's definitely a 2 person job that takes a good couple of hours and some skin off your hands. Fitting the safety net around it is also quite fiddly. Worth the effort though! It's also very heavy so I'm hoping the next storm won't have me collect it from the neighbours' garden."", 'Bought this for my 6 year old who absolutely loves it!

I'm an average DIY person and was quite scared of the mammoth activity of installing it on the basis of the reviews, so I took my time, reviewed everything without rushing. Daily after work spent 1-2 hours, started on Monday and on Wednesday it was ready to use. And to be honest, it was straightforward, main thing is follow the instructions to nth point. Instructions were very comprehensive , just keep on following step by step. But before you start, spend at least 1/2 hour reviewing all documentation and count all the installation bits and pieces so there is no surprise in the later stages. In my case, all bolts and pieces were fine except one piece (out of hundreds) which did not had hole in it which I drilled one to make, was not hard. In the end , quite stable piece of fun for the kids. My kids are enjoying it, and it does not make squeaky spring noise as well which I have heard in the past from other people's. All well. Only downside is linked product related to trampoline cover which one has to buy separately has poor ratings and reviews, and tbh even if you go out in the market to buy a general one, they also do not have great rating, so one will have to do bit of research to get a decent cover for winters."", 'Bought this two months ago as we needed a new trampoline for two growing boys and they love it', 'Am happy with this product', 'Really good quality,easy to put up and a great up to date design.', 'Bought trampoline for Easter and he absolutely loves it really worth every penny', 'Bought this for my grandchildren and they absolutely love and the size gives them so much room to play on trampoline is of good quality and easy to put together would highly recommend this product 👍', 'Got this when it was on offer!

Just wish it wasn’t damaged.', 'It wasn\'t *hard* to construct as such, but it was me and one of my boys doing it rather than the two adults recommended.  It\'s supposed to take 2 hours, and that would usually mean I\'d get it done in less time than that.  It took 3.5 hours!  There are LOTS of pieces, and it probably didn\'t help that it was raining and a bit windy when I was constructing it, but it was quite a palaver, where some things weren\'t entirely obvious, like which way round certain pieces go.  Some points are hammered home, but others not so much, so read the instructions carefully.  The worst bit by far was when you have to literally sew the netting to the springs: you get 7 long bits of string, essentially very long shoe laces, and have to thread them through custom holes in the netting that often don\'t exist or are hard to find!  The laces are also artificial fibre, making them a bit stretchy (a good thing, I guess) but also not very ""grippy"", meaning that if you don\'t tie them tightly, they will come undone.  I had to completely rethread the whole trampoline after a couple of days because it came undone.  It has been fine since, though.  We disobey the (frankly unrealistic) guidelines that only one person should go on at once - where\'s the fun in that?! - and have been fine so far.  Once it\'s up, it\'s a good sized trampoline, strong and robust, and easily handles me with both my boys bouncing on it.  I think it says 100kg is the maximum, but we\'re a bit more than that and it has been fine.  (Obviously I can\'t condone breaking rules, though!)  Anyway, it\'s a good trampoline for a good price, and I\'d recommend it if you\'ve plenty of time to build it carefully.', 'After loads of research we bought this trampoline from Argos.

All boxes were quite heavy and it was lucky I had my 12 year old daughter with me to steady the trolley as I put them in. Two runs later and some serious shoving and moving the boxes I managed to get them in my car with back seats down etc etc.   Getting them out was just as awkward so I cannot really understand why this product was not suitable for delivery !!!!

Also, some of the ties for the safety padding had ripped off during the three days of use.

Assembling definitely requires two people although I braved it myself and was only slightly injured. The build quality is great, however they made a design flaw - which the supplier confirmed when I contacted them - whereby the vertical bars protrude when you take the cover down (which again is very very hard to do with just one person). This means the covers they supply don’t fit, nor would any other cover. The larger size trampolines won’t have this problem as they’ll be wide enough to fit the poles. It’s not a huge problem - for longer term storage you can completely remove this poles. But if they failed to notice something as obvious as this when testing the product it’s not a great sign.

I’d read a few reviews that mentioned screws not lining up or falling out; if you use the tool supplied then yes, that will happen- just use a screwdriver to tighten; it works far better. We’ve had no issues. Some of the pipes didn’t line up so had to reposition till they did; that’s not manufacturer fault but mine. Also when setting up the frame, the corner bits kept falling out and I spent ages going over it thinking I’d done something wrong.. it wasn’t- once u put the bounce mat on with the springs, the tension pulls it altogether so don’t panic like I did!

Would not recommend', 'I bought this trampoline as my children wanted a larger bouncing area. They are 3, 11 and 14. It lasted a week! After one week of bouncing the mat was saggy and some of the springs were stretched.

For the money this is a great value and very well made/sturdy trampoline. Takes two people to put it together . My only negative is tying the netting which takes time and fiddly but the same with the other trampoline I had different manufacturer! Bought a cover also and do recommend this brand . Easy to drop sides etc to put cover on', 'Having looked around, this was one of the cheapest of this size, so a bit sceptical on quality!

Gives more space to bounce and we prefer the shape to the round ones.', 'We sourced a new trampoline back in January/February, we did a lot of research in trying to find one that our children really liked, this was the first oblong trampoline we have had. It was so much easier to put together, which resulted in a lot less huffing and puffing, the only thing I would say could be improved on is making sure there are two spring pullers to assist in putting it together. This is massive improvement over or previous models. All of the children that use it are over the moon as they feel they have more room to try different tricks, flips and anything else they want to try. A big difference is it does not move around as much as previous trampolines and this gives more confidence so backwards and forward flips are achieved with less effort involved. Overall a huge success with our children!', 'Changed from worn out round type to rectangular one , very straightforward to put up very clear instructions,  granddaughters love it .', 'The boxes for this are huge and heavy- be warned. There’s no way they would fit into a car and you’d probably struggle in a small van. Luckily I chose delivery! \r\nI put it together-mostly alone, in about 3-4 hours. The frame is heavy and sturdy. I haven’t actually been on it but the kids love it. It was a lot taller than I had imagined, it’s safe but my neighbours probably hate the sight of it! It doesn’t come with a ladder so smaller kids will need a hand to get on it (or purchase one separately). \r\n\r\nMy only issue was that two of the bars in the frame at the top of the net didn’t have holes drilled into them so I could not connect the pieces properly. They are holding together for now thanks to the other parts of the frame but who knows if they will retain their hold once I collapse the net .

I have big tree in garden so just wish the bird would stop pooing on it\r\nLol', 'The trampoline is a good shape and size, and the kids love it so its 5 star there. I managed to build it on my own, in about 3 hours with perhaps a couple of tricky moments so that was good. But its clearly cheaply made with some really questionable design choices. Firstly the frame is really heavy weight steel, so once it is built you better have it in the spot it is staying in! Secondly and more importantly, the netting is supposed to attach to the frame using a piece of twine to effectively sew it on, which I think is a pathetic option if consider this is what stops your small child from falling out of the side and 2 foot to the ground. I used zip ties all the way around  instead, but am not convinced this is a good long term option either. Easy enough to build, good size for older kids, but really dodgy safety feature.', 'I bought this for my kids and they absolutely love it.

Springs are rubbish and this was the worst quality trampoline I've ever purchased. I've purchased a different one since that was also cheaper and oh my god what a difference.

Was priced slightly higher than a round trampoline but was worth the extra for easy storage.', 'I brought this a month ago for my toddler and she absolutely loves it!', 'A little awkward to put together, some reviewers mentioned being able to assemble on their own but I find it hard to believe as you really need a second person at least to hold the netting poles on one side while you put screws and washer on the other.\r\nOther than that kids love it, reassuringly heavy so only time will tell how long it will last.', ""Make sure you check weight limit on this as i can't go on it with my boy"", 'Takes a while to put together you definitely need two people, but its q great product foe the money and kids love it!', ""I brought this as my great grand children needed one because of bad weather they've lost one they were delighted with it best i had done for them to see they face light up"", 'Amazing one of the best ones she had', 'Very poor quality.The paint in the middle keeps staining all the clothes.Arrived with small whole already.', 'I brought this as i was upgrading our circular trampoline.

Assembly is fairly straight forward, some of the ties underneath the protective edge padding have come away due to kids walking around edge.

It comes in to large boxes. When putting up make sure u count the holes in the poles, that u attach the trampoline to. As it took us a while to work out what was wrong with it. Though it was broken.

Was easy to put  together."", ""The trampoline is fab but I think it's important to point out that the jump size is 8ft x 12ft and the frame size is approx 10ft x 14ft, so bigger than we thought, which for us was great as we had the space.
