Straightforward to put up using the Youtube video (took me just shy of 6 hrs alone as the wife got tied up and i was stubborn to get it up for our girl before the rain came later that week) Endless jumping and bouncing fun she absolutely loves it and will hopefully have years of use from it. Great sturdy material and appears fairly weather proof. Easy to collapse down on windy days when we are away for a while. Good price for a great product! Would highly recommend', 'My grandkids love this trampoline. It arrived in 2 boxes which would fit in most hatchbacks. When we unboxed we found the parts check list and started checking. All the parts of the trampoline were there but no other paperwork. I phoned the manufacturer who emailed them through to me. All 30 odd pages, which I printed. The person on the phone told me ""not to worry about the missing safety warning sheet"" Hmmm\r\nAnyway. Two of us built the trampoline. It took a couple of hours. It did take a bit of muscle to pull all the springs on with the supplied tool. And it takes two people to raise the safety net into position. \r\nThe trampoline when fully built weighs about 45kg.  \r\nIt was placed on our lawn.  \r\nIt\'s been fairly windy this month (June) but even so I was shocked when the trampoline was blown over onto it\'s side.  If this happens in summer it certainly wouldn\'t stay upright in very windy conditions. So an anchorage kit is probably a good idea.  \r\nFortunately the top and netting folds down flat onto the trampoline.  It\'s easy to do and the instructions tell you how. Argos also has a video to show you.  We have folded the top down and bought a cover for it. \r\nYou can purchase a cover from the manufacturer for ¬£15  and most spare parts too.\r\nWhen it tipped over one of the plastic holders which fit to hold the top ring in place broke and I found replacements easily online by using a search engine. The manufacturer had them as out of stock at the time.\r\nSo despite our initial problems we have found the trampoline sturdy with plenty but not too much bounce for our young grandchildren. The netting is strong and all the springs are outside of the safety net for added safety.  There is a well padded mat over the springs so they can get in and out safely.\r\nSo happy children who should get years of enjoyment from  fun and exercise', 'Bought on sale was good value. Good quality materials and pretty simple to build', 'We purchased this for our 5 year old. She loves it, very spacious and bouncy. Easy to assemble.', ""Was looking for a good trampoline within a budget price, and I must say, the 8ft Sportspower is an absolutely amazing choice. \r\n\r\nProfessionally packed, great assembly  instructions and the quality  built.\r\n\r\nLooks great , feels great, happy kids happy parents)\r\n\r\nDon't look anywhere else, as I have looked through hundreds  of options and this one is the best !"", 'Great for my grandsons of 3 and 8. Not easy to erect and the netting is still not perfect.', ""Really good trampoline, seems to be great quality as I get to jump on it together with my son regularly and it hasn't collapsed yet. Be warned on the assembly, it's definitely a 2 person job that takes a good couple of hours and some skin off your hands. Fitting the safety net around it is also quite fiddly. Worth the effort though! It's also very heavy so I'm hoping the next storm won't have me collect it from the neighbours' garden."", 'Bought this for my 6 year old who absolutely loves it!

I'm an average DIY person and was quite scared of the mammoth activity of installing it on the basis of the reviews, so I took my time, reviewed everything without rushing. Daily after work spent 1-2 hours, started on Monday and on Wednesday it was ready to use. And to be honest, it was straightforward, main thing is follow the instructions to nth point. Instructions were very comprehensive , just keep on following step by step. But before you start, spend at least 1/2 hour reviewing all documentation and count all the installation bits and pieces so there is no surprise in the later stages. In my case, all bolts and pieces were fine except one piece (out of hundreds) which did not had hole in it which I drilled one to make, was not hard. In the end , quite stable piece of fun for the kids. My kids are enjoying it, and it does not make squeaky spring noise as well which I have heard in the past from other people's. All well. Only downside is linked product related to trampoline cover which one has to buy separately has poor ratings and reviews, and tbh even if you go out in the market to buy a general one, they also do not have great rating, so one will have to do bit of research to get a decent cover for winters."", 'Bought this two months ago as we needed a new trampoline for two growing boys and they love it', 'Am happy with this product', 'Am happy with this product', 'Really good quality,easy to put up and a great up to date design.', 'Bought trampoline for Easter and he absolutely loves it really worth every penny', 'Bought this for my grandchildren and they absolutely love and the size gives them so much room to play on trampoline is of good quality and easy to put together would highly recommend this product üëç', 'Got this when it was on offer!

Just wish it wasn‚Äôt damaged.', 'It wasn\'t *hard* to construct as such, but it was me and one of my boys doing it rather than the two adults recommended.  It\'s supposed to take 2 hours, and that would usually mean I\'d get it done in less time than that.  It took 3.5 hours!  There are LOTS of pieces, and it probably didn\'t help that it was raining and a bit windy when I was constructing it, but it was quite a palaver, where some things weren\'t entirely obvious, like which way round certain pieces go.  Some points are hammered home, but others not so much, so read the instructions carefully.  The worst bit by far was when you have to literally sew the netting to the springs: you get 7 long bits of string, essentially very long shoe laces, and have to thread them through custom holes in the netting that often don\'t exist or are hard to find!  The laces are also artificial fibre, making them a bit stretchy (a good thing, I guess) but also not very ""grippy"", meaning that if you don\'t tie them tightly, they will come undone.  I had to completely rethread the whole trampoline after a couple of days because it came undone.  It has been fine since, though.  We disobey the (frankly unrealistic) guidelines that only one person should go on at once - where\'s the fun in that?! - and have been fine so far.  Once it\'s up, it\'s a good sized trampoline, strong and robust, and easily handles me with both my boys bouncing on it.  I think it says 100kg is the maximum, but we\'re a bit more than that and it has been fine.  (Obviously I can\'t condone breaking rules, though!)  Anyway, it\'s a good trampoline for a good price, and I\'d recommend it if you\'ve plenty of time to build it carefully.', 'After loads of research we bought this trampoline from Argos.

It was so much easier to put together, which resulted in a lot less huffing and puffing, the only thing I would say could be improved on is making sure there are two spring pullers to assist in putting it together. This is massive improvement over or previous models. All of the children that use it are over the moon as they feel they have more room to try different tricks, flips and anything else they want to try. A big difference is it does not move around as much as previous trampolines and this gives more confidence so backwards and forward flips are achieved with less effort involved.

The frame is heavy and sturdy. I haven‚Äôt actually been on it but the kids love it. It was a lot taller than I had imagined, it‚Äôs safe but my neighbours probably hate the sight of it! It doesn‚Äôt come with a ladder so smaller kids will need a hand to get on it (or purchase one separately). \r\n\r\nMy only issue was that two of the bars in the frame at the top of the net didn‚Äôt have holes drilled into them so I could not connect the pieces properly.

I managed to build it on my own, in about 3 hours with perhaps a couple of tricky moments so that was good. But its clearly cheaply made with some really questionable design choices. Firstly the frame is really heavy weight steel, so once it is built you better have it in the spot it is staying in! Secondly and more importantly, the netting is supposed to attach to the frame using a piece of twine to effectively sew it on, which I think is a pathetic option if consider this is what stops your small child from falling out of the side and 2 foot to the ground. I used zip ties all the way around  instead, but am not convinced this is a good long term option either.
