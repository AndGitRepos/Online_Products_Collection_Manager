Battery life is reliable, lasting through most of a day with typical use.\r\n\r\nHowever, the performance can feel a bit slow for multitasking or heavier apps, as it’s equipped with an entry-level processor.

I connected it to my phone internet data via bluetooth. Doesn’t seem to tether usb only to charge, need to look into this.  Usual required apps can be downloaded. Tablet cover, stand, usb keyboard can be bought seperately if wish to.  Comes with a lenovo pen.. as yet I have not used.  Has the newer usb C connection cables.  Quite happy with the touch screen.  \r\nThe only thing that was slightly confusing.. which has nothing to do with the actual product itself..the argos £30 voucher which is advertised as part of the package. I think this should be clearer as I thought the voucher was given to you at collection/payment point.  So after collecting the item I returned to store to enquire about the voucher.  Told to claim when purchasing and there should be a claim button to click on.  So went back on argos purchasing app couldn’t find anything other than my receipt of full payment.  Confused I then did a chat help and after that didn’t help and told to go back and ask at store… I scrolled through all the help sections of the argos store website and eventually found that info for tablet and pcs vouchers. I bought this tablet in September and found the info stating to claim between 5Nov and 2Dec 2024 and to keep hold of receipt. Hopefully this is right.\r\nI initially thought I must have missed it and somehow should have claimed through the purchasing payment stages whilst online.\r\nThis I found all very confusing and time consuming and I think this should have been made clearer at the start.\r\nOther than this, I think the tablet is fantastic and glad I bought it.', 'I have been using my tablet everyday for a month.

Setting up was easy all the usual stuff of syncing acounts and updates and didn't take to long, I especially liked the fact that it could be set up from the start for a child but with overall control remains with an adult.

Guaranteeing updates to at least Android 15 in 2028.\r\n The actual feel of the tablet is very strong. Although i'm not going to be testing that out if i can help it. Lol.\r\n The display is really clear & sharp & although ive not put the sound system through it's paces as yet, the quad speakers are great for an immersive sound experience. \r\n If there is one negative i found then it is the fact that there is no charger included in the box. But thankfully, ive plenty of chargers lying around.\r\n Over all i would highly recommend this tablet. Ive added a 500gb micro SD card to the memory now so i have oodles of space for every day use.\r\nDefinitely worth the 5 stars i have given it."", ""I bought this tablet to help with a project and it ticks all the boxes.

Great functions', ""I have had this bargain-priced tablet for about three weeks and to date it is proving to be a good buy. I wanted a smaller screened model for ease of carrying around, a replacement for a faithful old Samsung, now no longer supported. Having seen very favourable comments on the Argos and Which? web sites, I decided to take a chance on this being ok, despite it's remarkably low price. I use it for email, web searches, maps, transport apps and music - and so far the performance has been excellent. Set up was easy and the  tablet feels very similar to the android presentation on Samsung devices. I just found one issue to be the default absence of what I find to be the really useful three bottom buttons (back, home and currently open tabs) which I eventually found how to turn on via system navigation in Settings.

The, home, back and clear buttons were always in the middle of the screen but with this one when you access apps, they move to the right of the screen (right as you look at it).  It seems pointless to have done that.  Also it can be difficult accessing the home icon depending on how far down the screen you are when you swipe up to access apps.  Also, with my old tablet I could swipe down anywhere on the screen to access Internet icon.  I only found out by accident that you have to swipe down to the right of the screen.

The size is perfect, not to small like the 7"" ones and not too large as the 10"" ones. The only problem with this tab is the upgraded OS which has minimised the navigation pan to the right side corner instead of having the normal large buttons. This makes it very difficult for kids to navigate through the tab. It does lack the Secure Folder option that you can find in Samsung, a feature that is needed for the average user but not kids.

This Tab M9 is the closest I could find which makes me wonder about the state of the small tablet market sector. The only aspect that has significantly improved is the price, I paid £225 back in 2018 for my Tab4, I paid £119 for the M9 (I was lucky and found a good deal).

Regretfully, Second Screen connection on S9 FE drops out when I descend stairs in my home - it goes when I\'ve reached one floor down. Now, please note I\'ve carefully tested the Wi-Fi signal and its strong at place where ""Second Screen"" drops out - I\'ve done several speed tests in areas mentioned to evidence this. Signal is also strong where I wanted to particularly use this feature (my living room two floors down from office pc). I want to occasionally use/access office pc without having to climb two flights of stairs, but even though I have a Wi-Fi Booster that works very well throughout my house, I can\'t do this. So this shortcoming is disappointing. Yes, 2nd screen connection feature does work, but the operating range is limited for whatever reason like I\'ve explained - and Wi-Fi strength is definitely not the problem - it\'s the distance between the respective devices within my home. This problem could be resolved somehow, but how? The S9 FE could obviously do with having this range problem fixed – there must be other users who want to use the same feature as me, but within any of their average house-size rooms?

I bought an adapter so I could view my photos which are on an SD card and on a USB stick and it was rather difficult to view them.  I would also like to be able to scroll through photos,  but I seem to have to open them individually. I did expect photos I took on my phone to also appear on the tablet,  like my emails etc so,  but I have to share them with it.  Maybe a feature needs to be included to make this happen automatically. I love the S Pen and find I rarely use my finger on the screen.  There are some apps it doesn't seem to work as well with.  I wish there was a way to get the keyboard to come up when I need it to,  rather than having to rely on it sensing there's somewhere to type, as it doesn't always do this.  I like being able to have 2 apps on screen and this is useful when the keyboard won't come up,  as I can get it in a second app. I have found other apps where you have to tap the screen,  which work perfectly well on my phone,  done always work on the tablet.

I decided to bite the bullet and treat myself to the galaxy tab S9 fan edition, in green so I can easily distinguish it from others on the table. I can honestly say I don't know how I've managed without a tablet of my own until now! I've used it to take notes (lots of them!) using the handy pen - and as those who know me will attest to, I'm a big fan of post it notes and the old fashioned paper and pen, so to have managed the seamless switch to digitised note taking the way that I have really underlines how user friendly it is! I even ditched my paper notebooks and only take my tablet to meetings now. I've played games on it - the sound quality is great and the resolution far superior to my phone (and the kids' screens!). I've used it for watching movies with the kids when they've been poorly, and when we've been sat in traffic it's come in handy for keeping the angst away when hooked up to my hot spot. The battery life is fantastic, and when it needs it, it is easy to charge with the USBC cable.

I decided it only made sense to write this on the tablet and more later but the on screen keyboard worked quite well when paired with Samsung notes. \n\nThe first surprise was that the tablet and packaging was in small enough packaging to fit through my letter box.  When taking out the tablet it straight away felt premium despite it being the budget version of their tablet range. \n\nThe tablet comes with the pen which is a nice addition but does not come with a charger. All models seem to be Wi-Fi and cellular so there is no choice if you just want the Wi-Fi version so you might be paying slightly more for something you don't need. \n\nThe screen straight away looks clean, crisp and full of colour. I was really impressed with the colours and watching content from Netflix or YouTube  that looked great on the screen. Audio on the other hand is a bit mixed, there are 2 speakers around the tablet on each of the shorter sides.  They sound reasonable but only work well in landscape mode, using the device in portrait to watch any media the sound sounds like its coming from the wrong locations, but does still work just not optimum as if its leaning on your lap your now covering one of the 2 speakers. \n\nI was really pleased to see that Samsung Dex comes on this tablet so it makes it a more usable and portable laptop replacement for basic tasks. Either get a USB C dongle or use Bluetooth devices and you have a nice portable laptop replacement.  \n\nInternet browsing seems quick and I didn’t find any websites that slowed down the device including YouTube so happy with browsing performance even with desktop sites. \nCamera quality is about on par with the expectations on a tablet but is good enough for document scanning or basic video calls. But I wouldn’t use it to take pictures too often etc, but fine for day to day uses. \n\nBattery life is good for the device, still not up to the standby times of an iPad but a good standby time of a few days when it’s not being used. I’d recommend charging unit every few days, maybe 3 or 4 days if your using for light use. Also supports quick charging so even 30 minutes on charge from a decent charger gives you a good charge percentage. \n\nOverall I was really surprised with the performance of this tablet, its much better than I was expecting and actually wish I’d gone forth larger size to be a better la"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tablet really surpassed my expectations.

Despite being a LCD screen the display looks amazing, crisp looking, with great  colour and decent black even without HDR support. Bright screen which looks great outdoors in lit conditions. \nThe audio is also nice, with clear undistorted sound on stereo speakers even a max volume.\n\nThe tab proforms well with decent frame rates on demanding games at higher settings, of your into that. The battery seems to last quite a bit even with heavy usage. If your using just for emails, checking and some browsing, it definitely last a good few days. Takes around 2 hours to fully charge so you can get back up and running quickly.\n\nThe multi tasking is great using dual apps at the same time is great and runs smoothly. The expandable memory helps you be able to enjoy all your pics, vids and file without filling up the onboard storage.\nOne of best part about the tab, the S pen comes as a great tool for general moving around the tab, note taking and writing on-screen but where it really shines is with graphic designing or digital art the pen is responsive and has great features to fulfill and design whatever you can imagine.\nThis tablet is truly one I can say is rated E for everyone as has something for everyone whether your a gamer, artist, looking for tab for video/movie watching or just need something for family members, young or old, this tab is definitely a great pick."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My initial thoughts of the Samsung S9 FE tablet are really positive. I've never owned a tablet but have used many. This one is robust and feels premium, the backing of the device is metal with a small camera bump. I love the fact it has all log in options a phone does (fingerprint, face unlock, PIN etc.) the power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner and isn't in the best location and I sometimes struggle to unlock the tablet without picking it up. \nThe camera is really crisp and clear with many options to alter to your preference or conditions. It does feel a little zoomed in / blown up for the screen size, but this is understandable on such a large screen. Which by the way looks really good under many different light sources.\nThe auto rotate is a little sluggish and doesn't react as fast as I'd expect, but I am still getting used to it. \nThe speakers are well placed and can be pumped up to a loud volume with no issues filling a room with sound. \nThe S-pen is also a fantastic addition and comes as standard. It's held on the top, bottom or back of the device and can be used instead of your fingers and gives additional options with the button on the side. Great for drawing, form filling, note taking and general navigation\n\nOverall I'm really impressed and can see this replacing my old worn out laptop - I'm certain that I'll be getting a keyboard and cover to help with some tasks."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So thrilled to have got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, I gotta say, it's a beast!

Right from the get go, this  product has been fantastic, it arrived promptly in a well packaged box, fully sealed and easy tabs to open the box. Upon opening the box your greeted with the product wrapped in a paper wrapping that neatly sized with pull tabs to lifted the product out the internal cavity that holds the item securely. Underneath the table you find a set of two slim branded white boxes that contain the usb c charging cable and instruction/warranty booklet. Also below the tablet is the multi touch stylus in complimenting colour to the tablet. In my case I chose the silver variant which comes with a white stylus, however it also comes in grey or light green colours, which are also fantastic.\n\nGetting to setup the tablet is just as simple and easy, upon powering the device it loads the brands logo and eventually walks you through a step by step wizard, that takes only 5~10 mins at most to complete. The device comes with 50-60% battery charge, plenty to set it up and get to use it. So far I’ve managed to easily load my ebooks to the tablet as it runs on the android operating system and has access to a host of apps (including free apps) via the play store. Its screen has fantastic resolution clearly displaying the text on screen from various ebooks. Also the processor is powerful enough to multitask between several apps, I managed to max out at about 8-10 apps before you notice some lagging but still usable. The battery also lasted a good while, I managed to recharge it to full and was able to use it for the full day and still had some charge to use it the next day before recharging. The stylus is also lightweight, just like the tablet and is perfectly balanced in sensitivity. It even has an onscreen bubble that guides the user as to where your stylus is pointing on screen when it is in close proximity. This makes it great for editing photos, as you can see where your stroke with impact the photo before even applying the stroke by touching the stylus to the screen. It’s so responsive that you can even control the thickness of artistic strokes based on the pressure applied.  Since it runs on android OS it has access to lots of free and paid apps via the play store to aid my photo touch ups and editing tasks. Screen wise it is smooth and clear as a display that is bright.

The first box is a white USB-C to USB-C cable, and the other box is a quick start booklet and a silver SIM tray/micro SD remover tray. \n\nI choose to go with a 128gb version of the tablet has I didn’t need anything with too much memory, has I can just install a SD card into it for the bigger memory. Not many tablets or even phones have this now. It does have 6GB ram, which is more than efficient for my needs. I’ve mainly used it for media consumption. I’ve got a large variety of applications on the tablet which just work with the tablet. \n\nThe screen is bright and easy to use and has auto dimming, It's been especially good when I'm going to bed and want to watch something. I don’t have to lower the brightness, or I'm walking around, the brightness will automatically go up. \n\nI also have a Samsung phone which means I can send and receive calls send messages but also share things between the two devices. Furthermore, I can take a picture with my phone or start writing something on my phone and then just share it to the tablet and edit it on the tablet with the S Pen.\n\nI've managed to so far customise the tablet using Samsung good lock and a few other applications that can be downloaded via the Samsung store to customise it. From the lock screen to how notifications appear on the screen. I’ve also been using the second screen function which integrates the tablet and a laptop to use it has a second screen, which has been excellent. I can also use the S pen has a mouse and highlight or click on the screen to go to certain things when in this function, or just the mouse between the screens. It is a learning experience when moving the mouse from one screen to another, but you get used to it.\n\nMy experience so far has been positive.

I like this S PEN the most, you can do so much and especially if you are passionate about drawing or you want to start learning how to draw, it is very good. has an application that teaches you how to draw certain animals or objects. since we have this tablet my daughter uses it daily especially when she draws and also when she plays some game on her tablet and then she uses this S PEN because she likes it and she tells me that it makes things more interesting.

Everything is nicely organized well protected and neat looking. It comes with a charging cable and a stylus pen.\n\nDesign:\nThe tablet looks awesome, It’s super slim and doesn’t weigh much, making it easy to carry around. The screen is tough with Gorilla Glass 5, so it won’t easily scratch. It has an aluminium casing which makes it a premium-looking gadget.\n\nPerformance:\nThe usability of this tab is smooth. The fingerprint scanner is a cool addition, unlocking feels easy and quick. The pen stylus is handy for drawing and taking notes. The stylus pen is non-powered, so you don't have to worry about replacing the batteries. The cameras take decent pictures, back camera is 8 MP and 12 MP for selfies. Plus, you can add more stuff with a memory card, which is great. The big 8000mAh battery keeps it going for a long time. It doesn't have a headphone jack which is a slight letdown but I can always use my wireless earbuds, so it's not a big problem for me. Moreover, this tab is IP68-rated, which means it's resistant to dust and water.\n\nMy Recommendation:\nIn my opinion, if you don’t mind missing a headphone jack, the Samsung Galaxy Tablet S9 FE is pretty good.

Within a few minutes I had wirelessly copied over the settings from my galaxy phone, choosing which bits to transfer and which to omit.\n\nHardware\n\nThe tablet is solidly built with a bright high quality screen, with a small bezel. It seems to weigh about average for a tablet of this size, and uses a widescreen format rather than a 4 by 3 ratio, which means most video media will fill more of the screen.\nThe speakers are very loud , but note there isn't a headphone jack, so you'll need use bluetooth for personal audio. Physical buttons include on off button (also has a fingerprint sensor to make it quicker to log on) , and a volume switch. Also included is the s-pen. As an ex galaxy note user I've always wondered how Samsung's pen interface would fare on a much bigger screen and I'm pleased to say its intuitive, giving a greater level of accuracy and creativity than non stylus tablets I've previously owned. The battery is lasting several days so far, with fast charging available. \n\nSoftware\nAnyone familiar with Samsung's ui will be at home - the tablet runs like a large phone. Both Samsung's and Googles app stores run on the device so plenty of app choices, with few pen enabled apps already installed- checkout PenUp for a fun time drawing and coloring ( specially if you have kids!).\n\nSummary \nThis is an excellent mid range tablet which should cope well with most people's demands, with the s-pen bringing an extra level of finesse for those who use it."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Straight out of the box it looks great, feels well made and fits easily into the hand.

And if you don't, you can start up and it comes with pre installed apps to get going.\n\nUsage Experience:-\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE is a clear improvement on its predecessor, the processor and battery have also been improved, making it a strong contender in the 11-inch Android tablet market. The screen is absolutely gorgeous and great for watching movies, playing games, or working. Plus, with the S Pen included, it can do all the note scribbling and drawing we want. One impressive aspect is that tablet is thin and lightweight.\n\n Pros\n\n    One UI takes good advantage of the large display\n    Extendable storage to 1 TB\n    Scrolling through the screen on a web page is really lovely. It is fast and responsive and the user interface is very    intuitive\n    In addition, plenty of accessories are available to turn it into the perfect ultra-portable laptop replacement (I have no problems connecting my wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard to use it for typing emails and notes)\n\n Cons\n\n    It can be a little cramped and underpowered if you're trying to do some intensive multitasking (multiple apps running lead to hang issues on couple of occasions)\n    Charging cable was supplied but without a plug. With a type C on both sides of cable there is no convenient way to charge\n    Fingerprint sensor should have been placed on downside of the screen and not on the right side of the tablet\n\nOverall Summary:- Great tablet with great specs for an awesome affordable price."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this tablet because I need some entertainment during a hospital stay. I really like this tablet. It ticks all the boxes I needed for entertainment during long boring days. \nI've played games on it with no lag on the highest visual settings.  I'm quite pleased that it can deal with most mobile games without issue. I've also streamed tv/movies all day long without having to plug it in - so the battery lasts ages.  The video is clear and crisp, and the sound is perfect. The connectivity is very stable, and I’ve not had any issues with disconnects at all. \nI've installed an app to test out the pen and it works amazingly well. It's like drawing on paper with an actual pencil. I would recommend for artists. It also makes signing digital letters quite easy as it’s far easier to sign with a pen than a finger. Moreover, it just snaps on to the back via magnet so it won’t easily get lost.\nThe second day of having it, I accidentally dropped it from about 4 feet to a concreate floor. IT SURVIVED. There's no way certain other tablets would survive that. \nThe cameras are passable, but not really something most people look for in a tablet."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung is truly investing in innovative products and Samsung S9 FE 256 GB is another feather on their hat.    Out if the box comes the tablet which I selected light green aluminum back and its beautiful. The box contains a stylus and C type charging cable buf no power adapter. The display screen size is 10.9"" and once switched on, the colours are vibrant. The tab comes with side mounted power button integrated with finger print sensor. The tablet is thin and perfect for travel and leisure. I bought the 256GB storage with 8GB RAM and its super fast. The picture quality is beautiful and so are the integrated speakers which have a good bass. On starting the tab updates the OS and can also connect to your older device over wifi and Samsung smart switch app which seamlessly transfers all files / apps from old to new. The tab also supports 1 TB micro SDXC storage so loads of space to store movies, pic, documents etc. The glass front display reflects light and the video can be supressed under strong daylight.  The12MP camera clicks great quality pics, 8000mA battery has enough power to last a couple of days and very light weight to carry anywhere. Besides the specs state it is dust and water resistant but I would not dare to pour water on my device even though Sansung has given a 3 year warranty.  Installed some games and its fast with no lags. So my initial reaction is.. Wow!!! Amazing Tab.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There are secure seals in order to open your new tablet. Once inside the tablet is wrapped in a special paper bag with 1 instruction on it about the S pen and where to locate it for storage. The back of the tablet has a magnetic space for the pen. This took me a minute to figure out as I was looking for a compartment. This holds pretty well, but does stick up off the back and can be knocked off. \nThere are no guides or manuals in side the case. This comes with the tablet, pen and charging cable in the box. This is a same double end cable, not USB on one end. \nI turned on the tablet and it asked if I wanted to link and old device, as my Samsung phone was near by it had already recognized it. The set up was easy and you can load from a phone or load what you like. The tablet does have a video showing you how to use and it's features. This boasts to be the first water and dust resistant tablet and S pen, have a low blue light emission for vision protection, long battery life and an expandable memory up to 1 T. This runs on Anderoid 13 and has a 5 MP front web cam. The FE stands for fan edition so you know this is a high quality product that customers trust. You are able to have texts from your phone appear and there are several preloaded products such as Samsung TV, free TV for streaming.\nThere are so many new features this will take a while to explore them all. \nThis is great new product perfect for adults or children. There are security measures in place for when children use the device. There are add-ons available like keyboards and cases. This is light weight 770g and the perfect size to work or be entertained on. The grafics are bar none and the photo quality is exceptional. I highly recommend this item."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've always loved Samsung and have other items in my household so they can easily link together. This tablet is a replacement for my really old convertible laptop that had gorilla glass screen so was incredibly heavy. It also had a flawed charging system as the cable could not be plugged in when the keyboard was attached. \n\nI was excited to open the box as it was tiny in comparison to a lot of other items I've had in the past. I like the fact there is very little wasted space so reduced packaging is better for the environment.  I struggled to get the seals open as they wouldn't come apart cleanly.\n\nMy first impression was that it is so much lighter than my old convertible laptop and seems lighter than older tablets that I have used in my place of work. This tablet is so light, you almost don't notice you're holding it.  \n\nIt functions the same as most other tablets using apps. I have ordered a keyboard for it as I'm going to use it like a laptop for things like emails. \n\nThe ease of drawing with the pen is great as I can doodle away when I'm thinking of things to do. \n\nHaving the ability to screen share to my other devices means I can find something online and cast wirelessly to my TV to show others."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely! Here's a testimonial for the Galaxy Tab S9 FE based on your feedback:\n\nWow, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE has truly impressed me!\n\nFirst of all, the S Pen is a game-changer. It feels so natural in my hand, perfect for jotting down notes, sketching, and even editing photos. I was surprised that my phone's S Pen works on the tablet too, instantly turning it into a productivity powerhouse. No more hunting for extra styluses!\n\nThe screen is a stunner. Bright, clear, and crisp, it makes watching movies, browsing the web, and reading ebooks an absolute joy. Everything pops with vivid colors and sharp details, and I was surprised how well it holds up even in bright sunlight.\n\nAnd let's not forget the portability. This tablet is lightweight and slim, making it the perfect companion for on-the-go entertainment and work. I can toss it in my bag and carry it around without feeling weighed down. It's like having a mini-computer at my fingertips, always ready to go.\n\nOverall, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE is a fantastic mid-range tablet that punches above its weight. The powerful S Pen, gorgeous screen, and incredible portability make it a versatile device for work, play, and everything in between. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and enjoyable tablet experience!\n\nI hope this helps!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung S9 FE is the first time I've purchased a mid-tier Samsung tablet rather than a flagship model. It's significantly cheaper than its flagship sibling and packs a lot of features into that price point.\n\nFirst, unboxing. The tablet sits snugly in the box along with the included S Pen and Charging cable. There’s no included mains adapter but for me that's a positive, I don't need any more!\n\nBuild quality is excellent and it feels like a premium device. A pleasant surprise is that it's hiding a micro-SD slot - Thank you to Samsung for keeping this feature!\n\nSetup was a breeze thanks to the setup assistant. Simply scan a QR code from an Android phone and it’ll transfer Google accounts and Wi-Fi settings. From initial switch on it was 5-10 minutes until the tablet was ready.\n\nPerformance of the tablet has been good. This covered watching videos, playing games and general app usage. Don't expect to be playing the latest games at max settings but it can handle most at medium with good FPS.\n\nThe 1440p IPS display is bright, vibrant and supports HDR content. Black levels are pretty good considering it’s not an OLED.\n\nI love the pressure sensitive S-Pen, Samsung have clearly put a lot of work into the features. Being able to annotate PDFs without a pdf editor is super useful.\n\nConnectivity is also good with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth and support for USB-C dongles. However, I was disappointed to find there was no support for external monitors via USB C. You can do screen mirroring via Wi-Fi though.\n\nOverall I'm very pleased with this device, it offers a lot of bang for the buck and it's a very good all round device. I can see us using this device for years to come."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the Galaxy Tab for a few days and it is now a staple in my day to day life. The set up was very easy, as I own a galaxy phone it detected another galaxy device was nearby and showed a QR code on the screen, to my surprise my phone then showed a box with my camera view ready for me to point at the QR code and once scanned my samsung account and Google account were up and running on the tablet and I could start using it straight away...very impressive!\n\nWhen using it for work my favourite feature has to be the screen select using the S-pen, it allows me to copy images seamlessly and when drawing around an image it shows a small zoom box so you can ensure you are drawing around the image very closely or you can just use the pre-drawn shape options. Once copied it is so easy to go back to your work and paste the image, you are able to move it anywhere on your document/presentation. I thought the S-pen would drag on the screen but it doesn't, it is like using a pen on paper. \n\nI have also used my tablet to watch movies and play games, the screen resolution is amazing and makes for very smooth viewing and gameplay. I find myself using the tablet to watch series/movies instead of turning the TV on these days!\n\nI have taken a few pictures using the tablet and the quality is very good, so much so that I prefer to use my galaxy tab for work meetings as the camera is much better than my work laptop.\n\nI would highly recommend this tablet for anyone, whether you are upgrading or buying your first galaxy tab this is the one to go for! You will not be disappointed, its a great allrounder that you could use for work or personal use as the display, camera quality, smooth switching between apps, smart select, s-pen overall motion smoothness, performance and battery life make it an all round great tablet."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Initial unboxing. Very nice packaging with easy to open seals on the box and a pleasant unboxing experience that feels premium. The tablet is wrapped in a nice fibre cloth with pull tabs. \nSetup of the tablet is straight forward and very quick. A couple of sign ins and your onto the desktop. The speed of the tablet booting is excellent and the desktop experience is smooth and fluid with no jittering. App installs are quick and the tablet can play or run any app you like.  The screen is where this table shines its bright clear and responsive. The speakers are also loud and clear and have a decent warmth to the sound akin to much larger speakers.  The pen that comes with the tablet is really nice to use. I have tried the notes taking app and the writing to text translation is brilliant.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the parcel and upon openning it was happy with the secure  and well packaged contents.  Along with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, I received an instruction manual, charging cable  and, S pen.  The tablet feels very well made and quality product, the weight feels nice in your hand as well.  It was very easy to start up the tablet and to go through the installation/setup process. So far I am impressed with the features on set up.  Also, you are given the option to transfer data from another tablet etc, which is very handy and saves you alot of time.  The screen is very fluid and responsive with the pen, sometimes I forget this is a touchscreen.   Now my dissapointment is that the charging cable is provided only and I will have to get a charger, as non of mine fit this C type.  Apart from this inconvience, I am well impressed with my first interaction of the tablet.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very happy with this purchase, first thing to note when unboxing is the construction which is has a premium feel with metal around the edges, a matte finish back and huge screen that gives excellent real estate for use. This tablet is equally comfortable for leisure activities and consuming media along with productivity, the CPU and RAM perform strongly and have not lagged in anyway. The screen is very smooth, sharp and provides excellent detail that is highlighted when watching movies in particular and combined with the AKG tuned speakers, it makes for a wonderful viewing experience that provides HD visuals and sound! The S-pen adds it's own suite of features that combine with the large screen and inbuilt features that include the Notes app.\nWhen compared to previous efforts from Samsung, it is clear how far their tablet range has come with years of experience being applied to produce an excellent product.\nThe only negatives I can really point to are the lack of a charger plug, the box only contains a USB cable so this must be considered as an additional cost however, this is only a small point in what is an excellent product with a vast array of usable features that link with any other Samsung product seamlessly."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well what better way to write your testimonial on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE than to hand write it on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE. Let's start with the SPen. The way it feels to hold is really smooth. Writing with it feels really natural as if using a pen or a pencil and I know that probably sounds obvious but others don't feel as comfortable as this one. Setup was really easy. If you use Google already just sign in and configure the device as you wish. And if you don't, you can start up and it comes with pre installed apps to get going. You can pick up the SPen immediately and start using the features of the S9FE. One reason I was looking at getting the S9 FE was to help with my daughters school work, the pre installed Kids app takes you to a parental controlled area that allows you to restrict access to certain apps that you might use on you main screen, and the kids need the pass code to get back out of the kids area. The S9FE is a good looking device, the screen size is great, not too small that you use a larger mobile device, not too big you can't use it as handheld. Its lightweight and durable so great for the kids to use too. If you use android this is an easy transition from your mobile to a larger screen device and a cool feature on the Tab S9FE allows you to use your phone as an overspill for the screen, and let's you smart view your mobile device onto the tablet too. I could go on about how much functionality this tablet has, but find out for yourselves, get one! I cannot recommend this enough."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm already a fan of Samsung products and this is not my first Samsung tablet however it is the fastest and sleekest Samsung tablet I have had, it's thin but still has some weight behind it that it doesn't feel delicate or that it's made from cheap materials.\n\nFrom the moment I turned this tablet on it was ready to perform to the way I wanted, it immedaitely offered to use Smart Switch so if you have a Samsung phone as well this would be the fastest way to tailor the tablet to your exact needs.  In this insrtance I didn't want to have my tablet as a carbon copy of my phone as I use them for different purposes.  Even without using Smart Switch it was really fast to log in and download the specific apps I wanted from the Play Store.\n\nThe screen is bright and colourful, the tablet is easy to use and although I didn't think the S Pen would be something I would need, I did enjoy using it although I think in the long run I will use my finger more.\n\nI highly recommend this tablet for it's speed and size and ease of charging.  It is a classy tablet and I know from experience that Samsung products do last well."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Firstly Unboxing - The Tab is very well protected in the box and seals are easy to break. When opening the box the tab was encased in a sort fibre cover and the pen nestled in the plastic underneath.\nTurning on and usung - The Tab doesn't take long to start up and just a few easy steps to setup and get started. Easy to transfer data and settings from old Tab using Samsung Smart Switch. The clarity and response of the screen are incredible and the speakers have very good sound. I have been using the Tab for both home and work and the it hasn't failed to impress. It also connected to the keyboard with no additional setup.\nOverall - This has to be one of the best Tabs, nice size and not too heavy when playing games."", ""I regret buying this tablet! It's a real pain trying to charge,  I have even bought another lead with a plug (which doesn't come with this, why not?) Sometimes after being on charge for some hours, I pick it up to find no charge at all! Apps that I'm used to on my lenovo tablet work differently on this, and not for the better. On the plus side it has lots of memory and it has a smooth screen action. I have mounted a glass screen protector  on this, and Sometimes won't recognise my finger action so have to operate with the pen. So I won't be getting rid of my old lenovo tablet any time soon, it's slow and a bit clunky, but it does what I need it to do with some functions. I bought this thinking it was a good upgrade, and wasn't cheap. So I feel let down, just like my two old Samsung phone that just stopped working for no reason."", ""Great little device. Oddly enough I see it as a natural successor to the s6 lite. It ticks all the boxes: value for money, fast enough, great OS, great range of built in apps. The screen is really very good whilst not an OLED it's still bright and punchy. The speakers are great too. And if you can get your hands on the keyboard folio case you've got a great little alternative to a laptop. \nYou can expand the storage via SD card too."", 'I am enjoying rhis device alot with this i using it for my daily use for alot of things. Netter than i expected. Got it on a crazy deal', 'Still getting used to the differences to my old tablet.

Hopefully she likes it.', ""The latest iteration of Lenovo's midrange tablet continues to offer support for a docking station and an input pen, maintaining its versatility. Despite the promise of modern software and a swift display for multimedia enthusiasts, the improvements appear to be accompanied by a few drawbacks. The tablet landscape has become more intricate with the presence of multiple versions, including the Tab P11 from 2021, Tab P11 Plus, P11 Pro, and P11 5G, creating a somewhat confusing array of choices.\r\n\r\nEnter the Lenovo Tab P11 2nd generation (labeled TB350FU for WiFi and TB350XU for LTE), featuring a new SoC but presenting modest upgrades otherwise. In a market flooded with new midrange tablets from manufacturers like Oppo and Honor, the Tab P11 2nd Gen faces increased competition, prompting us to assess whether it still manages to impress in our test.\r\n\r\nThe tablet maintains Lenovo's familiar case design, sporting a gray metal body with the top part crafted from rubberized plastic for enhanced reception. With a slightly larger display than its predecessor, the device is marginally larger and heavier but still feels comfortable in the hands, although stability could be improved. The build quality showcases smooth material transitions and clean edges, though a significant degree of warping and occasional creaking noises are noted.\r\n\r\nThe display is safeguarded by Gorilla Glass 3, providing decent protection against falls. The tablet boasts 4GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.2 flash storage in our test unit, placing it in the class average. It is also available in configurations with more RAM and a 4G version. Despite an official starting price of 399 Euros (~$441), the tablet is already discounted on Lenovo's official site and is further discounted by some internet vendors.\r\n\r\nNFC is notably absent, replaced by Pogo PINs at the bottom for connecting a docking station. The USB-C port operates at the slower USB-2.0 standard internally. The card reader, tested with an Angelbird V60 microSD card, delivers average transfer speeds but falls short of maximizing the card's full data rates. The tablet runs on Android 12 with security patches up to February 2023, awaiting potential future updates.\r\n\r\nLenovo adheres to its tradition of minimal modification to Google's operating system, and the number of preinstalled apps remains limited. Security updates are promised until July 30, 2025, providing assurance for a little over two years. However, the manufacturer remains silent on potential updates to the operating system itself.\r\n\r\nFor users seeking productivity, the tablet offers an optional Productivity mode optimized for keyboard and mouse operation. The Widevine L1 certification ensures high-quality streaming on major platforms, adding to the multimedia appeal of the device."", ""I changed  from an old Samsung Tab A that I bought new from Argos many years ago, to be honest the Lenovo is ok and works as it should but it's not as intuitive as my old Tab A the display is fine and the battery life is good enough but tbh I'm typing this on my old Samsung and my daughter will be getting a slightly used P11as an extra Christmas gift and I'll be watching the January sales for a good Samsung deal."", ""I bought it a week ago, i'm very impressed!"", 'I bought this a month ago and I am happy', 'Decent battery life gets the job done...', 'I purchased this product in November 2023 and I am pleased with its functions and its features.', 'I would recommend this tablet for the price,the colour is superb, well worth the money...', ""I bought this for my wife a few weeks ago...her Christmas present.

Had to buy a c usb adapter to use headphones and a c us card reader to read cards from car cameras etc.', ""Bought this after reading reviews about the value for money it offers. I wasn't disappointed. The screen is large and crisp. In its case I can easily angle it and use the on screen keyboard to type and word process. I will upgrade to a bluetooth keyboard in the medium term, but for now it is doing a cracking job. Netflix looks good on it as well."", 'Bought for uni and general use. So far have had no issues. Great big screen and good sound.', 'The tablet has good picture and volume sound quality.', 'Great piece of kit.. excellent sound and display... very fast and has android 13 out the box. Very impressed , so much so that I bought another one for my partner.', ""My last tablet cost around £800 (+£100 for keyboard), but when it was stolen I couldn't face spending that much again. Realistically, this has everything I need for a fraction of the price (no keyboard, but I rarely used it anyway). Plenty of storage for Netflix/Prime/Disney downloads. Decent screen/battery life. Sound is no worse, than any tablet. No discernible audio lag with my cheap Bluetooth earbuds. I play basic games and these are fine. Looks smart too. Only issue I have is the edges are too small, for my fat hands, which interfered with the touchscreen. So I bought a cheap silicon case for a tenner. Has a GPS for planning routes, etc, but no compass which made some app moan, not a big deal for me. Seriously making me consider HONOR's phone, when I need one next."", 'Good as any for triple the amount *****', 'Well made, easy to use and very stylish', 'I bought it a few weeks ago no concerns so far', 'Best quality and performance.', ""Purchased this tablet to replace a faulty Lenovo P11 2nd Gen from Curry's, that had to be sent back twice.

For the money, this is extremely well built and has Android 13 (at the time of writing). Everything works very smoothly with apps opening quickly and no lag. The screen is excellent and very bright.

Very good 5*', ""I recently purchased the HONOR Pad X9 11.5 Inch Wi-Fi Tablet in the stunning Grey color, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The tablet's sleek and stylish design immediately caught my eye, and it feels great to hold.\r\n\r\nWhat truly sets the Pad X9 apart is its remarkable performance. With 128GB of storage, I have plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. The Wi-Fi connectivity is seamless, ensuring that I can stay connected without any hiccups. The 11.5-inch display is vibrant and sharp, making my multimedia experience truly enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWhether for work or leisure, the HONOR Pad X9 delivers a fantastic user experience. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and feature-rich tablet."", ""I spent weeks Googling reviews for a new tablet. Not wanting to spend a fortune (there are some magnificent beasts out there if you're prepared to fork out hundreds!) I was simply looking for something bigger and better than my mobile phone with which to enjoy Social Media, Amazon Prime & Netflix Movies, YouTube and music. Bluetooth and WiFi are faultless. \r\nThis tablet looks good, sounds brilliant and has far exceeded my expectations for a budget tablet from a relatively unknown brand. I can thoroughly recommend the Honor Pad X9 and the impeccable service offered by Argos."", ""We got 3 of these tablets as the TV has been diabolical and we love a good app game. This is so easy to set up and is such good quality. The graphics are more than what you need. Loads of speakers for great sound. The feel of the tablet is good in your hands. My mother in law is 83 yes old and not very savvy when it comes to things like this and phones but watching her play word games and crosswords is a sight to behold. At the moment we are only using it to play games but the other features I'm sure will live up to my 5 star rating. We have taken pics also and they are brilliant and sharp."", 'I bought this table to read my music while playing in the band, the screen is bigger than most but still at a far price', 'I bought this a month ago and it’s absolutely amazing. The quality is so crisp and I use it more than my laptop now. I’m absolutely in love. The only thing I would say is the camera quality isn’t too great but not an issue for me because I wouldn’t use this to take pictures in the first place.', ""I had this a couple of weeks now and I'm very impressed with it. I was thinking about getting a Samsung but after seeing the specs of this and for the price HONOR is the way to go. Battery life is very impressive and ease how to get about the pad. Sound is louder than I thought and very clear picture I'm just about to buy another to give to my mum."", 'Bought this after my iPad reached end of life and couldn’t open any apps. Didn’t really use my iPad for anything but watching Netflix/ Disney etc, basic use of the internet and reading e-books so decided to purchase the Honour Pad X9 based off the fact it was the cheapest in the market and I couldn’t justify spending hundreds on an iPad to just watch films. \r\nThis ended up being the best decision I ever made! \r\nHave been using the tablet pretty much everyday for nearly a month and haven’t found any faults so far. Everything seems to open instantly, with no lags. Video quality is good when it comes to watching streaming platforms and the size of the memory on the tablet means I can download plenty of films / tv shows and books while still having plenty of memory left. \r\nAnother advantage is the tablet has numerous speakers meaning that the volume is a lot louder than my iPad. I’ve found this to be good because it means I can hold the tablet anyway and still have clear audio.\r\nAlso found that the battery life is significantly better than my old iPad - lasting ages before it needs putting on charging again. \r\nThe only downfall to the product is that I struggled finding a decent case and accessories for the tablet, which may be due to how unpopular it is in the UK market.', 'Excellent tablet, better than I had hoped.', 'My wife has a Honor phone and this tablet supersedes it. The camera is second to none. Everything is just as good as an IPad.. let’s hope it continues. Well done Honor', ""I bought this as a stop gap to replace a much more expensive tablet that was damaged. On opening the box I saw that it is an great looking device despite being so cheap with a metal body and a huge screen, I was very impressed. Upon first booting up I could see that the screen is not what I was used to (OLED) but for a TFT screen it isn't bad,  in fact everything mediawise was clear despite the lack of brightness and poor contrast. Netflix, YouTube and internet browsing looked okay and more than passable but the downfall was definitely when playing graphically intense games. Yes they booted up and played on low/medium graphical settings without stuttering but they all showed jagged lines and looked very pixelated. I wondered if this was possibly down to the \r\naspect ratio rather than the screen or graphics processor itself.\r\nAs a book reader, media streaming device or for browsing the internet this tablet is fantastic and the speakers sound great filling the area with sound. \r\nThe battery is fantastic, lasting a day or two easily. \r\n\r\nFor the price (less than £200) it is probably better than what you would expect and I would definitely recommend. It just takes some time to get used to if you have owned a premium device beforehand. \r\nPROS... Quality feel and looks, large screen, great speakers, awesome battery. Plays basic games amazingly well. \r\nCONS... Washed out colours, poor contrast and viewing angles. No gyroscope."", 'Very good quality. Fast tablet . The price is just amazing compared with what you get from the tablet.\r\nI Recommend this tablet for everyone that wants quality and cheap price', 'This tablet is just as good as the top priced tablets but with a more affordable price tag. \nWe use this as the family tablet and the downloading speed and quality is fantastic. We recently downloaded some movies on netflix to watch on a long journey for our children to watch and the download was very quick and a beautiful clear picture. Battery life is also so good and we fully charged, watched 3 movies and the battery wasnt even halfway down. \nSo sleek and thin, very stylish. Screen size is perfect.', 'In my opinion.. this is better than expensive apple products.. thanks a lot..', 'I bought this nearly a month ago and as soon as I started using it, I was mesmerised at how great it was for such a small price. The overall design and feel is premium. The responsive display with 120hz refresh rate is great and it’s not something you would typically expect to get on a budget tablet. I love my tech so trust me, for the price of this you certainly get more out of it.', 'Quite simply an outstanding tablet for the price! Excellent battery life and great screen. Very well finished as well, with a nice matte finish. Overall highly recommended.', ""At this price point, a tablet usually has too many compromises to be a serious proposition.  However, This is a quality bit of kit in all the areas that count on a budget tablet.  \r\n\r\nThere's no cutting-edge spec here, but the screen is colourful and performs at 120Hz, the case is one piece of solid metal, and the sound is top-notch.  It's built to be a streaming machine and it does this without issue. \r\n\r\nI'm surprised at how good this is for the price, and I'd recommend it to any budget-conscious tablet user."", ""This tablet for the price is very good. Seems fast, plenty of memory and running the most current Android. It's also not particularly heavy with extra bloatware you don't need.\r\n\r\nBe aware there is no SD card slot. But you can use an SD card reader to USB C converter, and then just use that in the USB C slot if you need to copy anything across from an SD Card."", 'I bought it one month ago but now I can see 20 GBP discount price', 'Although it was a little heavier than I thought or expected it to be, it’s very sleek design and quick set up. Fast and easy to use, it asks lots of questions to pair it with Honor devices but it can be used with a new or existing google account. All in all great device.', 'We have a lot of technology in our house but I have never used honor before, but I will say I am highly impressed! I did feel as it is cheaper tablet it wouldn’t be that great but me and my partner are both really impressed. This is just a cheaper version of an iPad really. I am yet to find something I cannot do on this. I run a business so I use cricut a lot and have had no issues with creating on there. It runs quick. Set up was super quick and easy. Battery life is fantastic. Sound is excellent. You have all your apps that you’d have on a regular iPad. I must admit we have always been apple snobs in this household but I would happily switch to using Honor and recommend it to others especially considering there is very little difference in the product itself but a big price difference! I simply cannot fault it. The screen is bright and large the keyboard goes the whole way across the screen so it’s very easy to type on also. It also has the feature to be able to speak to it “ok google” so if you are struggling to find something etc you can simply speak into it to help you. Front and back camera are handy although not the best camera ever but I personally don’t use a tablet to take photos so this isn’t an issue to me. Face recognition is available also if you’d like. Overall brilliant!', 'Being a keen user of technology I’m always looking for better having never previously using the Honor brand before I initially thought of it being a low budget brand but since using this tablet I can now happily tell you this is not the case in my honest opinion this is the perfect in between for Apple and android users, the OS feels very similar to apples while adopting features from android.\n\nIt was easy and super simple to set up out of the box taking no more than 5 minutes.\n\nThe display is bright and vibrant, the colour and contrast look wonderful. It features deep and rich sound from 6 speakers giving it a surround feel while watching movies and listening to music.\n\nThe battery life has impressed me the most compared to other brands of tablet using the device pretty heavily and still allowing me to get everything done without the worry of the battery dying.\n\nOverall this tablet gets a perfect score from me and I would highly recommend it, I will also definitely be buying Honor products in future.', 'The honour X9 is a great tablet. The initial set up is easy to do. It takes a while to sync the old device to it but once that is complete it is easy to use and self explanatory. The table features everything that you would need. The tablet is fast and does not glitch and downloads apps extremely well. It has a lot of smart features so that you can personalise it and gives helpful tips along the way. It is up to date with new technology features such as face recognition to open it. Would recommend!']"

Whereas she got over 10 hours of battery life with the 2nd Gen, she got about five hours with this 3rd Gen.  Very disappointing.\r\nAs I had paid £149.99 for the 2nd Gen from Argos, I did wonder why the more recent 3rd Gen was cheaper at £129.99 - when prices never go down - and now I'm of the opinion this is because the 3rd Gen is inferior to the one it replaced. It's clearly thinner so the battery is probably thinner and thus less capacity.  In addition the sound quality is poor compared to the 2nd Gen, and not as loud either. Again, probably due to the model being thinner. \r\nLong story short, she's gone back to using the older, 2nd Gen tablet because this one is a downgrade.

I am quite happy just working via the touchscreen for these sorts of tasks. However, I would consider buying a keyboard to write a lengthy document like a dissertation or thesis.\r\nSometimes I miss having a USB port that reads, so I can use my mobile broadband. I knew the USB port functionality was a design sacrifice at this price point. I have been able to use mobile broadband via my Lenovo laptop but have not been able to get the tablet to recognise my Motorola phone. I would need to go up a model to get a fully functional USB port.\r\nOverall, I cannot fault this little powerhouse of a unit!

The screen provides a very clear and crisp display.

The review said it was even better with the matching keyboard but that added £100 to the price... not if you bought it at Argos 😀.\r\n  It looks stylish and is very quick to flick through the tabs and with the 12"" screen is excellent for watching movies with a surprisingly good sound as well.\r\n  All in all i am very happy with this tablet it does all that i wanted.', 'Overall good value for money and the case is a plus', 'The honor 9 is one of the best tablets for the price range. \nUSB-C charging point with a lightweight and slender, stylish design \nFacial recognition or passcode.

However it is more light weight and thin. \nThe screen is remarkable, 12.1 inch and 120Hz with 2.5K resolution. The addition of 8 speakers made this tablet to sounds decent. \nThe 256Gb is more than enough for a tablet.\nCamera is decent, the pictures without editing looks ok.\nAnother strong point is the fact that it benefits from an 8300mAh large battery.\nOverall, it's a great tablet, but the charger is missing like in recent phone boxes."", 'Fantastic overall tablet, very good processor and screen size, and super bright and amazing picture quality, I cant really fault anything. It feels very well build and smart looking, and im really impressed with the battery life too. Very highly recommended.', ""I recently got my hands on the Honor Pad 9, along with its keyboard. Let me tell you, it's been a pretty cool experience so far. The screen is stunning—really bright and clear. It's got this massive 12.1-inch display that makes watching videos and scrolling through social media a treat. I didn't go for the one with the special screen that cuts down glare, but even without it, I haven't had any issues binge-watching my favorite shows.\n\nThe sound on this thing blew me away. It has eight speakers, which I didn't expect to be a big deal until I started using it. The audio is so crisp and loud; I haven't felt the need to connect it to any external speakers, even when I had friends over to watch a movie. It's been great for music and podcasts too, especially when I'm chilling or doing chores around the house.\n\nTyping on the keyboard has been a breeze. It feels high quality, with keys that have a nice feel to them, making typing up emails or working on documents way more comfortable than I anticipated. It connects magnetically to the pad, which is pretty neat, though it's a bit annoying that the case doesn't stay closed when I fold it up. A minor gripe, but worth mentioning.\n\nPerformance-wise, I haven't had any issues. It handles all the apps and games I throw at it without breaking a sweat. I'm not super techy, but I can tell it's got enough power for everything I need. The battery life has been solid too. I can use it for a couple of days without worrying about charging, which is a plus in my book.\n\nThe whole experience has been pretty smooth. I've found myself using it for all sorts of things—catching up on shows, reading, and even some light work thanks to that keyboard. It's quickly become my go-to gadget at home, and I'm pretty happy with it. The only thing I wish is that it came with some sort of stand or cover in the box, but that's not a dealbreaker. Overall, it's been a great addition to my daily routine""]"

It can even stretch to streaming services, having access to the Google Play Store for all the popular streaming apps makes this worth the while for those wanting to stream.\nBut, whatever you want to use this tablet for, don't expect to get it done in a hurry. The processing speed is severely lacking, everything I tried to do lagged - opening apps, typing, loading a movie. And if you want to play games, forget it. This tablet simply can't handle them, they just lag horribly.\nThe keyboard is a nice touch, and great for anyone who wants to type a lot, but I found the trackpad difficult to use. Let's face it, the Android OS isn't designed to be used with a mouse cursor, it's a mobile OS designed for touchscreen devices so using a trackpad just felt a bit off to me.\nIf you want a good quality product with a smooth user experience I would advise looking at something more expensive, but if you just want the basics then this could be ideal for you."", 'I brough this a few weeks ago and it’s been amazing for what I needed it for', 'Great for all ages ideal Xmas present', 'Really great size , can use the keyboard or touch screen which is really good. The screen is really brightly coloured. You can get all the apps you would use on a tablet /iPad. We got this for my son to use for homework in year 7 and it’s really good for this purpose too', 'I am overall satisfied with the Entity Tablet and have been enjoying using the product over the last couple of weeks\n\nFirstly the setup did take a little while but found it super easy and was able to setup with my gmail account. I love that it comes with a charger (wire and plug). It also has a detachable keyboard which is easy to apply on and off it holds the tablet really well which gave me the option of using hands free.\n\nI have used this mainly for social media , shopping , browsing / reading various websites , games and watching videos. There are many apps on the android / play store which sometimes downloaded super quick and other times a bit slow. This has been used as a family and my little ones have loved having set times to play games or watch videos and came in handy for online homework. \n\nI did find at times it would be slow / lag a little and when I would go to click a link or enter into a search bar the touch screen it wouldn’t register and then it would select a item underneath my search which became a bit repetitive/ annoying.\n\nBattery life I have been really happy with I think like most devices depending on how often you use the battery life will drain but I’ve found as I have limits on screen times for the children it’s lasted really well and for myself in the evening battery has been very reasonable. \n\nThere is also two cameras front and back , the photo / video quality is average it’s handy for team meetings / messenger chats. The screen size I am really happy with its a great decent size and image quality is really good. It’s light weight sleek and has a volume control button , built in speaker , Bluetooth connection, headphone and usb connection. \n\nFor me this is a great basic tablet to add to the household and is perfect for my family. I think that sometimes it runs a bit slow and the cursor not initially selecting what you click at times let’s it down but other than that I’m super happy with the device', 'I have got it for Christmas but I had a look to make sure everything was OK and yes great size the price was right and it works well. Just what I need', 'First impressions were sleek and compact, then I unpacked it to find it was on the heavy side. This comes with a USB-C charger which is compact and lighter than most standard laptop chargers and weighs less than the device itself. \n\nIt took me a little while to get it setup as I didn’t want to transfer things from another device. It has the option to transfer from other well known platforms too.\n\nIt’s a bit on the slow side and I don’t like the laptop cursor which is quite sensitive and the screen quite laggy. \n\nHowever, perfect for a first level and basic laptop or tablet. The keyboard can be removed to use as a tablet which makes it much lighter and more easily transportable. For me personally I think it will take me quite a bit of getting used to.', 'This tablet is very reasonably priced for what it is, the screen is a good size with clear display, it comes with an attachable keyboard which makes using it a bit easier and the keys are fairly spaced out if you struggle with touch screen. The tablet itself isn’t the fastest however can run standard search engines, I found it to be slow when loading up netlflix/YouTube videos. It’s small enough that you could fit it into your bag for travelling, sound is not the loudest so I would recommend a pair of headphones! Overall for the price worth it!', ""I'm undecided about this product. I've never owned a tablet with a keyboard before and whilst this addition can be extremely useful, I found the trackpad very difficult to move the cursor around and was quite unresponsive. However having a touchscreen monitor definitely made things easier. The tablet itself required no setting up and was easy to navigate (once I had finally found the on switch!). Battery life and sound quality are reasonable for the price. Initial start up comes with just the minimum range of Google apps but you can import from another device which is a nice touch and you can download whatever else you need from the Play Store. Overall, useful for basic tasks such as social media, browsing and watching videos and is nice and compact for travel but it is a little on the heavy side."", 'I bought this for my daughter who was asking for a tablet for a long time. I came across this and saw that it looked good. The item is reasonably priced. Comes in a good packing. Easy to use. It is both touch screen and can be used with the keyboard. Ideal for travel especially to places where there is weight restrictions. I am loving my mini laptop.', ""I didn't know what to expect when I got this item, but I am very impressed. \nFirstly this is a touch screen tablet that has an easily removable keyboard attached to it, with this keyboard attached it works like a mini laptop it’s great. \nThe feel of it is also good quality and at this price point it doesn’t feel cheap. After being a bit slow on initial start up the Entity tab performs well too, I loaded up a film to see how it would fare and I want disappointed. \nThe keyboard works well too, along with providing a makeshift case, it is a great feature. All in all this is a great quality and value item."", 'This tablet runs on Android 13, comes with removable keyboard so it’s like a laptop, wire and adapter for charging. It is great for basic use, typing, general browsing, watching videos on social media. \nHowever the sound is not the best, so wouldn’t rely on it for watching. Would say more for use Like a hospital stay and someone wanted to keep busy.  It could also be used as a child’s first tablet/laptop. \nIt’s a bit laggy, and It takes quite a while for initial set up but the battery seems good so far. \noverall the whole thing is quite sturdy and a little heavy for the size but feels well made. It’s for sure a starter tablet/laptop.', 'The Entity Tab G10 is a good entry level tablet with a fully detachable screen and keyboard giving you the best of both worlds when using. The Tab G10 comes fully installed with Android 13 and boasts 4gb of ram, 32gb of storage expandable up to 256gb, built in Wi-Fi and a front and rear camera. The tablet comes boxed with a power adapter, unusual these days but a welcome addition, instruction manual and quick start guide, it’s important to charge the tablet fully before first use as the start up and registration process can be quite a drain on the battery taking around 20 minutes from turning on to being fully operational. To use the tablet you will need a Google account to start with it being Android based. You can then browse emails, surf the web, watch YouTube etc and have full access to the Google play store with an abundance of apps. The tablet itself has a headphone jack, usb type c port, micro sd card slot and usb type a port down the side. The usb type c port allows data transfer as well as power and usb type a port is solely for devices such as a mouse, flash drive, printer etc. across the top you will find the power button and volume buttons. The tablet does have built in speakers but I found these to be quite poor and lack any kind of quality so would recommend using wired or Bluetooth headphones. Even with the 4gb of ram the tablet can be sluggish with delayed responses at times and on occasion the screen wouldn’t register touches especially in the corners unless you pressed harder and I feel it could have been optimised to run better but not a major issue. The battery has a 4500mAH capacity and lasts around 4 hours which is not long for a tablet of this size so needs to be charged often. Detaching the tablet from the keyboard is relatively easy but can be a bit tricky to reattach as you have to line up the tabs with the holes in the screen with the strong magnets pulling them together but you get used to it after a while. Overall a decent little entry level tablet.', 'I bought it at the start of November and I haven’t had a single problem, the set up was easy as well. It is very light and compact so easy to take on trains etc but still big enough to watch Netflix and do work.', 'Streaming, browsing and light gaming handled easily. Battery life is satisfactory. Screen could be slightly more responsive, but overall very happy, especially for the price.']"

Using it all day, reading and streaming, 8 hours of battery life isn't a problem. It is just the right size to pack away in your bag, with a screen size that is still watchable on the go. I love it. \n        Absolutely love the 'origami' case. so stable in both portrait and landscape orientations. This case actually protects the keys, something lacking with the A7 lite case.

The facial recognition is good and useful for unlocking. I like the 8 gig memory and  I bought the 128gb storage version. The micro SD is up to 1tb so you can carry as many movies, or sport videos, as you could want.

Good quality, nice and fast. I like the small size as I'm not keen on the larger tablets, I like to be able to hold it in one hand. Only down side was that it didn't come with a wall plug so had to spend more to get one as all the plugs/cables I already have are usb/micro usb and the cable provided is usb cboth ends. I do think that when spending over £200 it should come with a wall plug"", ""Had the A7 Lite since launch and that model was not very useful beyond watching videos ect the A9 has a vastly superior processor and the 128GB model has 8gb of RAM making it able to do most things like games ect without issue.

One of the other reviews complained there was no hdmi out, well it doesn't need one because we are in 2023/2024 we can screen share to TVs and Google Chromecast etc. what are you going to use NFC on a tablet for? It's not necessary for a tablet, unless you want to look like a weirdo going into a shop to pay for your items. Lol it's got Bluetooth and all the things you need, you can expand the storage and it's got a headphone jack! Those are great things! Very responsive and very happy with the product.

Finally it has gyroscope!', 'Great features except one I wanted.............I mainly purchased the S9 FE Tablet because I wanted to be able to use ""Second Screen"" feature - so I could access my Desktop work pc (in office upstairs in my home) from my living room two floors below. Regretfully, Second Screen connection on S9 FE drops out when I descend stairs in my home - it goes when I\'ve reached one floor down. Now, please note I\'ve carefully tested the Wi-Fi signal and its strong at place where ""Second Screen"" drops out - I\'ve done several speed tests in areas mentioned to evidence this. Signal is also strong where I wanted to particularly use this feature (my living room two floors down from office pc). I want to occasionally use/access office pc without having to climb two flights of stairs, but even though I have a Wi-Fi Booster that works very well throughout my house, I can\'t do this. So this shortcoming is disappointing. Yes, 2nd screen connection feature does work, but the operating range is limited for whatever reason like I\'ve explained - and Wi-Fi strength is definitely not the problem - it\'s the distance between the respective devices within my home. This problem could be resolved somehow, but how? The S9 FE could obviously do with having this range problem fixed – there must be other users who want to use the same feature as me, but within any of their average house-size rooms? I appreciate the range can\'t be unlimited, but Wi-Fi is strong throughout my home, so why doesn\'t this connection stick? Thanks, Graham', 'Good build quality and ease of use.

When taking out the tablet it straight away felt premium despite it being the budget version of their tablet range. \n\nThe tablet comes with the pen which is a nice addition but does not come with a charger. All models seem to be Wi-Fi and cellular so there is no choice if you just want the Wi-Fi version so you might be paying slightly more for something you don't need. \n\nThe screen straight away looks clean, crisp and full of colour. I was really impressed with the colours and watching content from Netflix or YouTube  that looked great on the screen. Audio on the other hand is a bit mixed, there are 2 speakers around the tablet on each of the shorter sides.  They sound reasonable but only work well in landscape mode, using the device in portrait to watch any media the sound sounds like its coming from the wrong locations, but does still work just not optimum as if its leaning on your lap your now covering one of the 2 speakers. \n\nI was really pleased to see that Samsung Dex comes on this tablet so it makes it a more usable and portable laptop replacement for basic tasks. Either get a USB C dongle or use Bluetooth devices and you have a nice portable laptop replacement.  \n\nInternet browsing seems quick and I didn’t find any websites that slowed down the device including YouTube so happy with browsing performance even with desktop sites. \nCamera quality is about on par with the expectations on a tablet but is good enough for document scanning or basic video calls. But I wouldn’t use it to take pictures too often etc, but fine for day to day uses. \n\nBattery life is good for the device, still not up to the standby times of an iPad but a good standby time of a few days when it’s not being used. I’d recommend charging unit every few days, maybe 3 or 4 days if your using for light use. Also supports quick charging so even 30 minutes on charge from a decent charger gives you a good charge percentage. \n\nOverall I was really surprised with the performance of this tablet, its much better than I was expecting and actually wish I’d gone forth larger size to be a better la"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tablet really surpassed my expectations.

Despite being a LCD screen the display looks amazing, crisp looking, with great  colour and decent black even without HDR support. Bright screen which looks great outdoors in lit conditions. \nThe audio is also nice, with clear undistorted sound on stereo speakers even a max volume.\n\nThe tab proforms well with decent frame rates on demanding games at higher settings, of your into that. The battery seems to last quite a bit even with heavy usage. If your using just for emails, checking and some browsing, it definitely last a good few days.

The expandable memory helps you be able to enjoy all your pics, vids and file without filling up the onboard storage.\nOne of best part about the tab, the S pen comes as a great tool for general moving around the tab, note taking and writing on-screen but where it really shines is with graphic designing or digital art the pen is responsive and has great features to fulfill and design whatever you can imagine.\nThis tablet is truly one I can say is rated E for everyone as has something for everyone whether your a gamer, artist, looking for tab for video/movie watching or just need something for family members, young or old, this tab is definitely a great pick."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My initial thoughts of the Samsung S9 FE tablet are really positive. I've never owned a tablet but have used many. This one is robust and feels premium, the backing of the device is metal with a small camera bump. I love the fact it has all log in options a phone does (fingerprint, face unlock, PIN etc.) the power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner and isn't in the best location and I sometimes struggle to unlock the tablet without picking it up. \nThe camera is really crisp and clear with many options to alter to your preference or conditions. It does feel a little zoomed in / blown up for the screen size, but this is understandable on such a large screen. Which by the way looks really good under many different light sources.\nThe auto rotate is a little sluggish and doesn't react as fast as I'd expect, but I am still getting used to it. \nThe speakers are well placed and can be pumped up to a loud volume with no issues filling a room with sound. \nThe S-pen is also a fantastic addition and comes as standard. It's held on the top, bottom or back of the device and can be used instead of your fingers and gives additional options with the button on the side.

I can go a whole day without searching for a charger.\n\nThe S Pen is a game-changer – doodling, taking notes, it's like having a mini notepad that's always with me. The handwriting to text recognition gets it right more often than not but it can be a bit hit and miss with my handwriting anyway!\n\nThe performance is snappy, apps open in a blink. The speakers are loud and clear, making movie nights a blast.\n\nOverall, the Tab S9 FE rocks. It's not just a tablet; it will be my go-to for work, play, and everything in between!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tablet arrived  promptly, though I thought it was a book due to how small and lightweight it was on delivery.\nThe magic however happens once the packaging is removed, it reveals a beautifully crafted device well packaged. It had everything in it apart from the charger head. This little setback was easily fixed. \nAfter charging, the battery power is very long lasting. The speed and accuracy at which you’re able to use the device effectively.\n\nThe best bit for me was the inclusion of the pen. The pen is sleek, attaches to the tablet which makes it portable supporting the efficiency of the device.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the first time I have had a tablet in about 10 years. I have been using my phone to do all my browsing, social media, online shopping, etc. And so I thought it was about time I got a new tablet. I am a Samsung fan anyway, so it was a no brainer for me to get this tablet.\n\nI have been really impressed by the screen, the sound, and especially the s-pen. In fact I am writing this review with it right now! The only trouble is I keep going to bed too late as I am having too much fun on the tablet.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been only the look out for a great cheap tablet that I could use as a stop gap to allow me to read ebooks and edit my photos on the go.  Right from the get go, this  product has been fantastic, it arrived promptly in a well packaged box, fully sealed and easy tabs to open the box. Upon opening the box your greeted with the product wrapped in a paper wrapping that neatly sized with pull tabs to lifted the product out the internal cavity that holds the item securely. Underneath the table you find a set of two slim branded white boxes that contain the usb c charging cable and instruction/warranty booklet. Also below the tablet is the multi touch stylus in complimenting colour to the tablet. In my case I chose the silver variant which comes with a white stylus, however it also comes in grey or light green colours, which are also fantastic.\n\nGetting to setup the tablet is just as simple and easy, upon powering the device it loads the brands logo and eventually walks you through a step by step wizard, that takes only 5~10 mins at most to complete. The device comes with 50-60% battery charge, plenty to set it up and get to use it. So far I’ve managed to easily load my ebooks to the tablet as it runs on the android operating system and has access to a host of apps (including free apps) via the play store. Its screen has fantastic resolution clearly displaying the text on screen from various ebooks. Also the processor is powerful enough to multitask between several apps, I managed to max out at about 8-10 apps before you notice some lagging but still usable. The battery also lasted a good while, I managed to recharge it to full and was able to use it for the full day and still had some charge to use it the next day before recharging. The stylus is also lightweight, just like the tablet and is perfectly balanced in sensitivity. It even has an onscreen bubble that guides the user as to where your stylus is pointing on screen when it is in close proximity. This makes it great for editing photos, as you can see where your stroke with impact the photo before even applying the stroke by touching the stylus to the screen. It’s so responsive that you can even control the thickness of artistic strokes based on the pressure applied.  Since it runs on android OS it has access to lots of free and paid apps via the play store to aid my photo touch ups and editing tasks. Screen wise it is smooth and clear as a display that is bright. It’s  a perfect companion for my travels', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So finally got the Samsung s9FE which is an upgrade from my previous tablet, it came in a white box with a picture of it with a pen on it. When you first open the box, the tablet is there in a white protective sleeve. Under it is the S pen with two white boxes. The first box is a white USB-C to USB-C cable, and the other box is a quick start booklet and a silver SIM tray/micro SD remover tray. \n\nI choose to go with a 128gb version of the tablet has I didn’t need anything with too much memory, has I can just install a SD card into it for the bigger memory. Not many tablets or even phones have this now. It does have 6GB ram, which is more than efficient for my needs. I’ve mainly used it for media consumption. I’ve got a large variety of applications on the tablet which just work with the tablet. \n\nThe screen is bright and easy to use and has auto dimming, It's been especially good when I'm going to bed and want to watch something. I don’t have to lower the brightness, or I'm walking around, the brightness will automatically go up. \n\nI also have a Samsung phone which means I can send and receive calls send messages but also share things between the two devices. Furthermore, I can take a picture with my phone or start writing something on my phone and then just share it to the tablet and edit it on the tablet with the S Pen.\n\nI've managed to so far customise the tablet using Samsung good lock and a few other applications that can be downloaded via the Samsung store to customise it. From the lock screen to how notifications appear on the screen. I’ve also been using the second screen function which integrates the tablet and a laptop to use it has a second screen, which has been excellent. I can also use the S pen has a mouse and highlight or click on the screen to go to certain things when in this function, or just the mouse between the screens. It is a learning experience when moving the mouse from one screen to another, but you get used to it.\n\nMy experience so far has been positive. The only bad thing I have is that there is no headphone jack on the tablet, but not many new tablets do."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I will start by saying everything that I have is from Samsung, I just love this brand, but this was the first tablet from them, I was a bit worried that won't be the same as my phone, that will go slow, but I was so wrong, set up was so easy, pen is amazing, I just love it!

The collaboration between my other Samsung devices makes it easy to pick up where I have left off, able to share  quickly.  Added security from pre installed Smart things app to allocate my phone & vice versa. \nMy browsing experience has been soo much better than just using my phone alone. \n\nWatching TV has been good with a crisp picture and good sound too.\n\nOverall I am quite impressed of the quality of the Tab with nothing negative to report back.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I decided after a few years to change my tablet because it had started to move more slowly and I changed it to this tablet because it is newer and has an S PEN. what I can say about this tablet is that it is very fast and has a very nice design and is made of durable material and has a large battery to be able to use the tablet for several hours. it is also water and dust resistant. I like this S PEN the most, you can do so much and especially if you are passionate about drawing or you want to start learning how to draw, it is very good. has an application that teaches you how to draw certain animals or objects. since we have this tablet my daughter uses it daily especially when she draws and also when she plays some game on her tablet and then she uses this S PEN because she likes it and she tells me that it makes things more interesting.

Only critisism is the lack of charger in the box as it only come with a cable- but as it wasn't a USB cable (it was type-c on both ends) I couldn't use my phone Charger so had to buy a new plug. overall, I am very i mpressed and looking forward to testing more features."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] From the offset I am impressed with this tablet.\nInstantly I've found the build quality to be outstanding and the size to weight ratio is outstanding. I've experienced other tablet devices of a smaller size screen that weigh more and that are much more clunky than this. This S9 FE tablet is slim, strong, and very well finished.\nThe processing power in this tablet allows for all of the basic tasks and a whole lot more. Thanks to the very capable processor and screen size I have been able to complete a whole host of tasks, including taking part in video calls whilst looking at and editing multiple documents, alongside emailing colleagues with slides and other attachments. This tablet can handle a busy load and does so effortlessly.\nOne of my favourite features of the tablet is how easily it connects to other devices, such as my phone (S23 Ultra) and my Buds2Pro. The connections are seamless and simple. Having the ability to send messages from the tablet and also take calls is an absolute game changer when I'm in workmode \nI cant recommend this tablet highly enough.

Everything is nicely organized well protected and neat looking. It comes with a charging cable and a stylus pen.\n\nDesign:\nThe tablet looks awesome, It’s super slim and doesn’t weigh much, making it easy to carry around. The screen is tough with Gorilla Glass 5, so it won’t easily scratch. It has an aluminium casing which makes it a premium-looking gadget.\n\nPerformance:\nThe usability of this tab is smooth. The fingerprint scanner is a cool addition, unlocking feels easy and quick. The pen stylus is handy for drawing and taking notes. The stylus pen is non-powered, so you don't have to worry about replacing the batteries. The cameras take decent pictures, back camera is 8 MP and 12 MP for selfies. Plus, you can add more stuff with a memory card, which is great. The big 8000mAh battery keeps it going for a long time. It doesn't have a headphone jack which is a slight letdown but I can always use my wireless earbuds, so it's not a big problem for me. Moreover, this tab is IP68-rated, which means it's resistant to dust and water.\n\nMy Recommendation:\nIn my opinion, if you don’t mind missing a headphone jack, the Samsung Galaxy Tablet S9 FE is pretty good. It looks nice, works well, and has some cool features. It is great for someone who wants a reliable tablet without getting too fancy."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Unboxing\n\nThe Samsung tab 9 box features barely any wasteful plastic, relying on cardboard and paper to keep the tablet safe. The tablet doesn't come with a charger- just the usb c cable, so bear this in mind if you are new to the world of usb.\n\nSetup\n\nIf you are already in the samsung ecosystem setup will be a breeze. Within a few minutes I had wirelessly copied over the settings from my galaxy phone, choosing which bits to transfer and which to omit.\n\nHardware\n\nThe tablet is solidly built with a bright high quality screen, with a small bezel. It seems to weigh about average for a tablet of this size, and uses a widescreen format rather than a 4 by 3 ratio, which means most video media will fill more of the screen.\nThe speakers are very loud , but note there isn't a headphone jack, so you'll need use bluetooth for personal audio. Physical buttons include on off button (also has a fingerprint sensor to make it quicker to log on) , and a volume switch. Also included is the s-pen. As an ex galaxy note user I've always wondered how Samsung's pen interface would fare on a much bigger screen and I'm pleased to say its intuitive, giving a greater level of accuracy and creativity than non stylus tablets I've previously owned. The battery is lasting several days so far, with fast charging available. \n\nSoftware\nAnyone familiar with Samsung's ui will be at home - the tablet runs like a large phone. Both Samsung's and Googles app stores run on the device so plenty of app choices, with few pen enabled apps already installed- checkout PenUp for a fun time drawing and coloring ( specially if you have kids!).\n\nSummary \nThis is an excellent mid range tablet which should cope well with most people's demands, with the s-pen bringing an extra level of finesse for those who use it."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Straight out of the box it looks great, feels well made and fits easily into the hand.

It also has a Micro SD slot for added memory should I need to add any\n\nit was an easy and quick process to set up with just a few buttons to click and it integrated seemlessly with my Samsung phone. All I needed to do was place it next to my tablet in order to copy over my settings and anything else I wanted to.\n\nI like the aspect ratio of the screen. The landscape orientation lends itself nicely to streaming movies/TV which a squarer screen doesn't always do. I have used it to stream quite a bit and so far I've been impressed by its performance. The pictures are sharp, the colours are vibrant and the sound from the dual speakers is great. \n\nThe processor was quick and could handle all I asked of it with no lagging or stuttering and I am impressed by the battery life too. It lasts more than long enough for everything I need to do before needing a recharge.\n\nAs well as streaming I have used it for occasional web browsing, emailing and online shopping, all of which it has done flawlessly\n\nFor a casual tablet user like myself I would say this one is perfect.

And if you don't, you can start up and it comes with pre installed apps to get going.\n\nUsage Experience:-\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE is a clear improvement on its predecessor, the processor and battery have also been improved, making it a strong contender in the 11-inch Android tablet market. The screen is absolutely gorgeous and great for watching movies, playing games, or working. Plus, with the S Pen included, it can do all the note scribbling and drawing we want. One impressive aspect is that tablet is thin and lightweight.\n\n Pros\n\n    One UI takes good advantage of the large display\n    Extendable storage to 1 TB\n    Scrolling through the screen on a web page is really lovely. It is fast and responsive and the user interface is very    intuitive\n    In addition, plenty of accessories are available to turn it into the perfect ultra-portable laptop replacement (I have no problems connecting my wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard to use it for typing emails and notes)\n\n Cons\n\n    It can be a little cramped and underpowered if you're trying to do some intensive multitasking (multiple apps running lead to hang issues on couple of occasions)\n    Charging cable was supplied but without a plug. With a type C on both sides of cable there is no convenient way to charge\n    Fingerprint sensor should have been placed on downside of the screen and not on the right side of the tablet\n\nOverall Summary:- Great tablet with great specs for an awesome affordable price."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this tablet because I need some entertainment during a hospital stay. I really like this tablet. It ticks all the boxes I needed for entertainment during long boring days. \nI've played games on it with no lag on the highest visual settings.  I'm quite pleased that it can deal with most mobile games without issue. I've also streamed tv/movies all day long without having to plug it in - so the battery lasts ages.  The video is clear and crisp, and the sound is perfect. The connectivity is very stable, and I’ve not had any issues with disconnects at all. \nI've installed an app to test out the pen and it works amazingly well. It's like drawing on paper with an actual pencil. I would recommend for artists. It also makes signing digital letters quite easy as it’s far easier to sign with a pen than a finger. Moreover, it just snaps on to the back via magnet so it won’t easily get lost.\nThe second day of having it, I accidentally dropped it from about 4 feet to a concreate floor. IT SURVIVED. There's no way certain other tablets would survive that. \nThe cameras are passable, but not really something most people look for in a tablet."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung is truly investing in innovative products and Samsung S9 FE 256 GB is another feather on their hat.    Out if the box comes the tablet which I selected light green aluminum back and its beautiful. The box contains a stylus and C type charging cable buf no power adapter. The display screen size is 10.9"" and once switched on, the colours are vibrant. The tab comes with side mounted power button integrated with finger print sensor.

The12MP camera clicks great quality pics, 8000mA battery has enough power to last a couple of days and very light weight to carry anywhere. Besides the specs state it is dust and water resistant but I would not dare to pour water on my device even though Sansung has given a 3 year warranty.  Installed some games and its fast with no lags. So my initial reaction is.. Wow!!! Amazing Tab.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There are secure seals in order to open your new tablet.

I like the fact there is very little wasted space so reduced packaging is better for the environment.  I struggled to get the seals open as they wouldn't come apart cleanly.\n\nMy first impression was that it is so much lighter than my old convertible laptop and seems lighter than older tablets that I have used in my place of work. This tablet is so light, you almost don't notice you're holding it.  \n\nIt functions the same as most other tablets using apps. I have ordered a keyboard for it as I'm going to use it like a laptop for things like emails. \n\nThe ease of drawing with the pen is great as I can doodle away when I'm thinking of things to do. \n\nHaving the ability to screen share to my other devices means I can find something online and cast wirelessly to my TV to show others."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely!

The tablet sits snugly in the box along with the included S Pen and Charging cable. There’s no included mains adapter but for me that's a positive, I don't need any more!\n\nBuild quality is excellent and it feels like a premium device. A pleasant surprise is that it's hiding a micro-SD slot - Thank you to Samsung for keeping this feature!\n\nSetup was a breeze thanks to the setup assistant. Simply scan a QR code from an Android phone and it’ll transfer Google accounts and Wi-Fi settings. From initial switch on it was 5-10 minutes until the tablet was ready.\n\nPerformance of the tablet has been good. This covered watching videos, playing games and general app usage. Don't expect to be playing the latest games at max settings but it can handle most at medium with good FPS.\n\nThe 1440p IPS display is bright, vibrant and supports HDR content. Black levels are pretty good considering it’s not an OLED.\n\nI love the pressure sensitive S-Pen, Samsung have clearly put a lot of work into the features. Being able to annotate PDFs without a pdf editor is super useful.\n\nConnectivity is also good with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth and support for USB-C dongles.

One reason I was looking at getting the S9 FE was to help with my daughters school work, the pre installed Kids app takes you to a parental controlled area that allows you to restrict access to certain apps that you might use on you main screen, and the kids need the pass code to get back out of the kids area. The S9FE is a good looking device, the screen size is great, not too small that you use a larger mobile device, not too big you can't use it as handheld. Its lightweight and durable so great for the kids to use too. If you use android this is an easy transition from your mobile to a larger screen device and a cool feature on the Tab S9FE allows you to use your phone as an overspill for the screen, and let's you smart view your mobile device onto the tablet too. I could go on about how much functionality this tablet has, but find out for yourselves, get one! I cannot recommend this enough."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm already a fan of Samsung products and this is not my first Samsung tablet however it is the fastest and sleekest Samsung tablet I have had, it's thin but still has some weight behind it that it doesn't feel delicate or that it's made from cheap materials.\n\nFrom the moment I turned this tablet on it was ready to perform to the way I wanted, it immedaitely offered to use Smart Switch so if you have a Samsung phone as well this would be the fastest way to tailor the tablet to your exact needs.  In this insrtance I didn't want to have my tablet as a carbon copy of my phone as I use them for different purposes.  Even without using Smart Switch it was really fast to log in and download the specific apps I wanted from the Play Store.\n\nThe screen is bright and colourful, the tablet is easy to use and although I didn't think the S Pen would be something I would need, I did enjoy using it although I think in the long run I will use my finger more.\n\nI highly recommend this tablet for it's speed and size and ease of charging.  It is a classy tablet and I know from experience that Samsung products do last well."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Firstly Unboxing - The Tab is very well protected in the box and seals are easy to break. When opening the box the tab was encased in a sort fibre cover and the pen nestled in the plastic underneath.\nTurning on and usung - The Tab doesn't take long to start up and just a few easy steps to setup and get started. Easy to transfer data and settings from old Tab using Samsung Smart Switch. The clarity and response of the screen are incredible and the speakers have very good sound. I have been using the Tab for both home and work and the it hasn't failed to impress. It also connected to the keyboard with no additional setup.\nOverall - This has to be one of the best Tabs, nice size and not too heavy when playing games."", 'I bought this to replace an older Samsung tablet. This is my 3rd Galaxy Tablet and each one better than the previous model.', 'I bought this as there was an offer for some galaxy buds fe which I am still yet to be accepted for after being repeatedly knocked back! Still debating whether to return tablet and go to someone else! Overall tablet is great.', ""I regret buying this tablet! It's a real pain trying to charge,  I have even bought another lead with a plug (which doesn't come with this, why not?) Sometimes after being on charge for some hours, I pick it up to find no charge at all! Apps that I'm used to on my lenovo tablet work differently on this, and not for the better. On the plus side it has lots of memory and it has a smooth screen action. I have mounted a glass screen protector  on this, and Sometimes won't recognise my finger action so have to operate with the pen. So I won't be getting rid of my old lenovo tablet any time soon, it's slow and a bit clunky, but it does what I need it to do with some functions. I bought this thinking it was a good upgrade, and wasn't cheap. So I feel let down, just like my two old Samsung phone that just stopped working for no reason."", ""I purchased the Samsung tab S9 FE at the begining of Janaury and im very happy with the device and it's capabilities."", 'I bought this month for my wife and she was so excited 😊', ""I've been looking to buy a new table tor a while, as my old Samsung A6 is now around 8 years old and is showing it's age. I looked around and saw the S9 FE version. It's just for my personal use so I thought it perfect for me which it is. Very responsive, good colour and clarity when watching. Lots of features and notepad app with pen, which I don't use much yet, but it's there.\r\nI am a Samsung fan anyway, my phone and TV are Samsung models. They are the best as far as I'm concerned and I've no complaints as to their devices and service. Thumbs up from me."", ""Samsung have let themselves down badly in recent years. I've always been a big fan of the galaxy range, both phones and tablets. Unfortunately with the demise of the Tab 8 there is very little decent choice. The Tab 7 never lasts more than 12 months before it slows down to an almost dead stop which leaves this new Tab  S9 FE at 11inches, but it's very heavy and not meant to be carried around like the smaller Tabs. Time Samsung brought back a smaller quality device. The main reason for low score ? My wife an I are in our 70's, disabled and have problems holding it."", ""Great little device. Oddly enough I see it as a natural successor to the s6 lite. It ticks all the boxes: value for money, fast enough, great OS, great range of built in apps. The screen is really very good whilst not an OLED it's still bright and punchy. The speakers are great too. And if you can get your hands on the keyboard folio case you've got a great little alternative to a laptop. \nYou can expand the storage via SD card too."", 'I am enjoying rhis device alot with this i using it for my daily use for alot of things. Netter than i expected. Got it on a crazy deal', ""This is a decent device for that price point, however do not expect flagship experience. You can play some games, battery life if above my expectations. Unfortunately this device do not support hdmi output through USB C cable (you can't stream to your TV via cable. Wireless works but it's far away from cable capabilities). Good screen, loud speakers."", 'Still getting used to the differences to my old tablet.

I thought this would be ok & would be able to use one of the multiple lead plug chargers i have at home for various devices. But no, it's different. I'll be returning the whole device for a refund.

I use it for YouTube, browsing, and taking notes, and it handles multitasking / spit screen really well.  Need to work with it more, but so far it ticks the boxes on performance / responsiveness, screen clarity, sound (good stereo and a bit of bass), and battery life.  The fingerprint sensor is also reliable.\r\n\r\nHigh end users / gamers might need a bit more oompf, but for must casual / everyday users, this is a great tablet with the added bonus of useful stylus."", ""It's easy to use simple and great for drawing with a really sleek UI ITS great any of my real issues come from the pen itself \nIt's nib is flimsy and will be easy to break if it lands wrong \nThe pen in general is a little uncomfortable to hold with the flat side feeling really abrupt \nThe magnets that attach the pen to the ipad are horrible and I've dropped my pen a couple times because the magnet just didn't hold the pen\nAnother key thing is the removal of samsungs greatest feature the ability to brows your files is such a strong point of why I love Samsung this feature is completely locked which makes adding mods to games like Minecraft ot terraria (as an example) impossible \nSo if you want this as a gaming tablet I don't recommend it\n\nBut other than these it's a great tablet for artists it runs smoothly I'd just recommend buying the pro pen with it or buying multiple nibs beforehand"", 'Does all that I need and more', 'I am still learning but I do find it a bit top heavy with my wrap keyboard on my lap.', 'Extremely powerful and fast tablet', 'Very pleased with this tablet.

I already have Honor Mob phone that gave me impressive experience; this one is an added experience that comes loaded with most advanced specifications with 256 GB storage large enough to store multiple photos, videos and office work. Sound quality, thanks to its 8 integrated speakers, is impressively loud & clear that gives hypnotic acoustic experience to any exposure. Beautifully designed round-shaped camera gives untraditional look as it makes the pad look quite expensive with high-value pictures & video quality. \nThe smart multi-window function allows us to run multiple apps and tasks with powerful performance, thanks to 8GB RAM that do not make it slow ever. \nThe packaging, unfortunately, does not include charger or Quick Start Guide; it only includes tablet and cable. Also, it has only Start and Volume buttons, no sign of any memory card or USB slot apart from the type C charging slot. As the Pad itself is quite expensive, I wish Honor could include some pouch or case to protect it from scratches and damage. Overall, the tab is undeniably valuable, making it the best companion for our life.']"

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra mobile phone. Samsung Galaxy 360 Laptop and a Samsung smart TV hence the reason for purchasing this S9 FE+ tablet. I wanted the new S9 ultra OLED but I couldn't afford it at the time but the S9 ultra OLED is now on sale and with the cash back offer as well as trade in and a free Galaxy 6 watch it makes it a fantastic offer. I would have definitely waited for the S9 Ultra OLED offer if I'd have know as I use my S9FE+ for art work and colouring too so I am disappointed in that aspect but the S9FE+ is still a good tablet. It connects easily to my phone as well as my Samsung TV. In the description it says that it isn't compatible to smart view to a TV but it definitely works on my TV with ease as I can mirror the tablet screen to the TV when we do our online food shopping so my wife can tell me what to add from the comfort of her armchair. It's a pity that my Samsung TV has now come up with a on screen message saying that I now need to buy a newer TV for it to display my Ring cctv cameras. Even though the TV still works fine. This as definitely put me off purchasing Samsung from now on. I changed from owning all A*ple products to Samsung because they forced you to upgrade items to new models by not updating the software for the older equipment (5 years) isn't old and not everyone can afford to keep upgrading. I must admit though if Samsung keep offering the deals to upgrade there technology as they have at present then that's good. The S9 FE Plus tablets is very responsive, good quality display screen even though it's not a AMOLED screen. The sound is very impressive especially when watching 4K UHD on YouTube. I also use the tablet to watch sports TV on my Virgin account and it copes really well but obviously this all depends on the Internet speed. The tablet also makes it easier being able to have finger print recognition for log in and passwords. This is a real bonus for me due to suffering with memory problems. I also have the tablet set to adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambience which it also deals with effortlessly. The smart pen is also easy to use and get used to especially if this isn't the very first experience using a smart pen, if it is your first time, using a smart pen then just practice and it will become se and nature. The smart pen with the FE+ Tablet doesn't have as many options as the Pro pen but I have found it to be enough for my needs. I also purchased a hard silicone protective case with built in screen protector and put the tablet straight in it from new to help keep it safe.

The S9 FE Plus gives you a great sized screen for entertainment viewing and most of the top features without the £1000+ flagship S9 tablet price.  I looked at a lot of reviews and comparisons before getting this but am happy with my choice. It seems to have a lot of good features for productivity, almost a computer mode.

For more serious matters I can seamlessly convert the tablet into laptop style with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

It's really light and have no problem with it"", 'I was looking for a tablet to have around the sofa. I opted for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. Firstly, with a 12.4"" screen, it\'s huge! Akin to carrying a notebook around. But, it fits the bill. Plenty of nice crisp screen real estate and reasonable sound to play with. Just be warned, that - with the sizeable battery, too - it has real heft to it. So far it\'s been great though. Researching from the sofa has never looked so good. The device is slick and looks and feels really premium. The inclusion of the S Pen is great too. Precision and speed. For now, I\'m very pleased indeed.', 'I am on it all the time screen is fantastic for watching TV on 1', 'I love it lots and it is the best samsung device to ever exist!', 'I love my new  Galaxy  tab S9. IT responds much quicker and better all round than my Apple I pad. I can now print from it  which  I could not do with my  I pad.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First Impressions: As a busy professional in my 40s, I'm used to juggling multiple tasks and demanding tech. So, when I got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+, I was immediately impressed by its sleek design and eco-friendly packaging. Ditching the unnecessary bulk felt refreshing, and setting it up with my existing Galaxy S22 via QR code was a breeze – the easiest setup I've ever experienced with any gadget!\n\nPerformance Powerhouse: I primarily use tablets for multitasking, social media, gaming, and browsing. The FE+ tackled everything with ease. I could play GTA3 flawlessly while downloading other games in the background – not a single stutter or lag. It's a multitasking beast! The vibrant 12.4-inch display made everything a joy, from browsing newsfeeds to watching movies. Colors were crisp, viewing angles were generous, and the clarity truly enhanced the visual experience, especially when admiring landscape photos I took with the camera (more on that later!).\n\nS Pen Versatility: Speaking of the S Pen, it's a game-changer! The built-in pen is incredibly versatile, perfect for jotting down notes, sketching, or even editing photos. And the best part? My existing Galaxy S22 pen works seamlessly with the FE+, eliminating the need for extra accessories. This continuity across devices is something I truly appreciate.\n\nCamera Captures Memories: While I wouldn't consider myself a photography enthusiast, the FE+ surprised me with its camera quality. Family portraits and landscape shots came out stunning, with vibrant colors and sharp details. Even zoomed in, the pictures retained their clarity, making it a joy to capture life's moments.\n\nOther Highlights: Battery life has been impressive, easily lasting a full day of moderate use. The speakers deliver decent sound, though stereo speakers would be a welcome upgrade for audiophiles. The software experience is smooth and familiar, thanks to the familiar Samsung interface. And pre-installed apps haven't been intrusive, which is always a plus.\n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is a fantastic tablet for anyone looking for a versatile powerhouse. It excels at multitasking, delivers stunning visuals, and boasts a surprisingly good camera. The S Pen integration and seamless connection to my existing Galaxy phone make it an even more compelling option. If you're a busy professional or someone who simply wants a reliable device"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My experience with Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ has been exceptionally positive from the outset, even before unveiling of the device from the box. I always pay attention to the amount and quality of the packaging. There was no excess of it, all from recycled sources and printed with soy ink and no plastic in sight. Yet the packaging had a quality feel, mirroring the premium feel encapsulated within the tablet itself. Tablet is very slim and light. Its aluminium body feels very premium. The set up process was straightforward, seamless and relatively fast; I managed to transfer all my applications and contacts from my phone using QR code in the process. Very quickly I could access my frequently used apps and download many more. I am very pleased with 128Gb capacity and a possibility of extending it further to 1TB thanks to the memory card slot. \nBoth the tablet and accompanying pen boast water-resistant properties, although I have refrained from putting this feature to the test. I had a little accident with the device when I slipped and fell. It was stored in a thin, temporary sleeve and I thought it might break or at least the screen would crack but nothing like that happened. Since then I am convinced it is a well build, robust piece of tech made to last, reinforcing my confidence in its durability. Nevertheless, a prudent investment in a protective cover has been made to safeguard against potential scratches, mishaps and prolong its lifespan. \nThe screen is bright with vibrant colour reproduction yet my eyes do not get tired. I spend often long hours at the screen editing photos and the fact that this display is designed with reduced blue light emission is very thoughtful. \nThe stylus provided a delightful user experience. Handwriting recognition feature is working great and I had a chance to sign few documents using it. It works perfect in drawing apps, feels natural and reacts differently depending on the pressure variations. Its compact and lightweight design makes it an ideal companion for on-the-go drawing, without compromising on drawing space.  It is fun to use it even with the simplest drawing app, as my usual app for drawing is not available on Android I had to shop around for an alternative. I was successful in finding few and they all were a pleasure to use. \nThe tablet serves as a proficient tool for photo editing, despite its slim profile, the tablet boasts an impressive battery life, further enhancing its appeal.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought a Samsung tablet some years ago, whilst it did it\'s job it never really satisfied, it always felt cramped and didn\'t function quite how it should have done.\n\nSo, the biggest upgrade, the real estate: you wouldn\'t think that an extra 2"" on the screen size would make that much of a difference; if you look at my second photo, you\'ll see that when placed side by side the Tab S9 FE+ doesn\'t look that much larger, but when it\'s in your hands it\'s a night and day difference in the feel. As I already mentioned, my old one felt cramped, the new one just feels wide open, it fills the space in front of your face and your hand is free to roam widely. I know you can get 14"" tablets, but in light of my experience I would say they would probably end up feeling overwhelming.\n\nIf anyone ever had a choice about what size tablet to purchase, I would definitely recommend 12"" as the perfect place to settle on.\n\nNow, performance, unless you\'re running extremely demanding apps you generally won\'t notice problems, I can say the S9 FE+ definitely felt more responsive over my old one, but that was more a subjective feeling. What I did know was that the S9 FE+ was happily running some games that my old one couldn\'t, despite it technically being specced up enough, again, see my second photo showing the S9 FE+ actually playing Crying Suns whilst the other only has a message saying it\'s not capable.\n\nAnother performance improvement, connectivity with other devices, in this case connecting to my Samsung Galaxy Book 3 laptop, see my third photo: the old tablet was meant to function as a second screen, but it would only do so after enabling a hidden developer menu function. Every. Time. The S9 FE+, however, actually showed up when my laptop scanned for external devices and connected seamlessly, just a single click with the mouse; it also benefitted from the larger screen size, the higher resolution, and no lag when moving the mouse cursor across on to it. It will actually prove to be usable for this function, whether as an expanded screen or as a duplicate for someone to observe what\'s being displayed on my laptop.\n\nLastly, sound output is a definite bump up from my old tablet, though a slight nitpick that my fingers tend to end up sitting over the speaker grilles... However, the quality and volume is immersive, a nice surround effect enveloping your head, you know it\'s powerful when your fingers start vibrating when you stick them in the wrong place!\n\nUpgrade Recommended!!!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We have been looking for a new tablet for a while as our old one was just that, old, and a bit clunky so this is a great replacement for us. \n\nInitial impressions upon opening the box are that its really sleek looking. Super thin and streamlined and even comes in a box slim enough to fit through the letterbox (although to achieve that it does mean that no charger plug comes in the box which is a big negative mark for me considering the pricepoint) \n\nThe screen on this tablet is huge! And super clear with bright vivid colours and high definition images. Very impressive and runs films/TV well as well as making more standard stuff like games, notes, spreadsheets super clear. \nWe also tested it with a few super high res clips (2060p) and it handled that pretty well even despite a bit of lagging. \n\nI was most excited about the S pen feature as we are currently planning a wedding and thought this would be brilliant for taking notes and all the plans we are making, and the S pen does not disappoint.... Mostly. \nI have found that it can be rather glitchy and one some apps (such as the play store) you can't use it at all so this is the main reason I can't give the tab 5 stars. I have also experienced issue swith it while using sheets, particularly when trying to write text in cells instead of numbers. \nIts a big selling point in all the media releases and i feel it's just a little too glitchy and could do with some improvements and polishing - hopefully that will come in future updates. \nIt is satisfying to use though and still my favourite feature of the tablet. \n\nOverall this is a really nice tablet. Its a brilliant size with the 14 inch screen yet is lightweight and slim so doesnt feel too chunky and still feels portable. \nIt is absolutely a perfect upgrade foem our old android tablet and were rwally enjoying putting it through its paces and exploring all of the features. \n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new tablet, especially if they use it a lot for watching videos/fims/shows ect."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ 256GB arrived in a super slim white flat box along with the S Pen, a USB type C charging cable and pin for opening the SD memory card slot. First impression was how slim the tablet was which did mean that there is nowhere to stow the pen unlike my old tablet (A minor issue to be honest).\n\nAfter charging I set about setting up the tablet with my existing Google account credentials. I decided to copy the apps and settings from my Samsung Galaxy S20+ phone rather than my old tablet as my old tablet contained mostly outdated and limited apps.  Using the Samsung Smart Switch app on both my S20+ phone and the Tab S9 FE+, the transfer of all my apps, files and photos was simple and straightforward. However, it did take a little while due to the considerable number of photos and videos to transfer but that was only to be expected. On completion all my apps and photos were copied over and ready to use. With 256GB of storage space there is ample capacity for my purposes and I imagine for most other people too, but if not then there is an SD memory card slot for even more storage.\n\nBattery life has been very good and lasts me for days. You need to provide your own charger which is disappointing but seems to be the norm these days. I don\'t have a high power USB C charger so haven\'t been able to test the quick charging function. However, I usually just plug it in overnight and it\'s 100% full by the morning.\n\nMy primary use is for watching videos and social media. The picture quality of the 12.4"" screen and sound quality are excellent, way better than my old tablet. The touch screen is sensitive and accurate as you would expect. I am looking forward to making use of the S Pen for drawing and note taking. It turns out that the pen with my previous tablet also works with the new Tab S9 FE+ so that\'s a bonus if the pen is ever lost.\n\nThe power button doubles up as the fingerprint sensor making it very convenient to use. Much easier than entering a PIN or drawing a pattern although those options are also available.\n\nI bought a protective case and applied a screen protector to fend off any knocks and scrapes which with the best will in the world are inevitable at some point.\n\nOverall I am delighted with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ and it has been a very overdue upgrade of my old tablet. Hopefully it will last me for a good few years to come.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Setting up was painless from my Galaxy S23. Connecting the two with a USB cable and a scan of a QR code and my software was duplicated.\n\nA recent update to One UI 6.0 makes it more like having a super sized phone, as the tablet can make calls / SMS through my linked phone.\n\nThe screen admittedly is not OLED, but still very good – 12.4”, bright and vibrant - then again the full-fat Tab S9 is twice the price.\n\nThe option to add a microSD memory card up to 1TB is great.\n\nSome have complained about problems multitasking, but as it is a tablet - I only usually run one App at a time and it excels.\n\nStreaming video and music is great as the speakers are very good and it’s IP68 water and dust resistant.\n\nI’ve been making use of the PENUP software to rekindle my interest in art, which works surprising well.\n\nBattery life is very good. Using a 45W charger (not included) it take about an for a full charge. I don’t really need to keep checking it, as it’s generally still has 50% charge when I think of topping up.\n\nNo headphone jack, but you could always buy a USB-C to headphone convertor.\nHandwriting recognition is good feature, to convert to text or even dial a number from one you have written on the screen.\n\nAll in all, a great mid-spec tablet, which beats all the entry level competition and punches above its weight – to challenge the best in class. It’s also a great companion for a Samsung smartphone improving the experience of reading digital media and streaming content.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having owned one of the earlier model first Samsung tablets, which I was using up until quite recently, I was amazed  what a different beast Samsung now has to offer.  Samsung's technology, graphics and just as important sound capabitiies have progressed so much in such a short time.\n\nThe overall sophisticated feel and look of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is of quality and sleek styling. The tablet was extremely easy to set up once out of the stylish packaging and pretty much guided you through the whole process from start to finish.  \n\nCharging time is extremely quick but would have liked it to hold its charge a little longer than it did. I found it made more sense turning the tab off completely when not in use to save from charging it so often.\n\nOnce setup, it was very easy finding my way around, especially when adding apps and setting up my emails.  The graphics were outstanding and the 12.4 inch screen was great to surf the net with but particularly came into it's own when watching movies.  The colours, quality and sound could rival most high end television brands yet alone rival tablets!  I've never felt the urge to watch movies on anything other than my main TV but since owning the tablet it has been great to have the additional option.\n\nThe tablet has been a useful tool for my university note taking and creating sketches with the handy S Pen.  Far cleaner than scrappy bits of paper which were easily mislaid.\n\nThe unit also has a slot for an SD card which is a handy feature for obtaining additional memory. Slight disappointment when I found I could not use headphones as no place to insert them so will need to purchase Bluetooth ones. \n\nI highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ for work, pleasure and that all important college / university work."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was looking for a tablet that excels in the everyday essentials, without breaking the bank.

Videos play with stunning clarity, vibrant colors, and crisp sound from the dual speakers. The processor easily handles everything I throw at it, from casual browsing to online shopping, with zero lag or stuttering. Battery life is a major win, lasting significantly longer than I need between charges.\n\nS Pen Magic:\n\nThe included S Pen adds a whole new dimension to the experience. Jotting down notes in Samsung Notes is smooth and natural, and the magnetic attachment keeps it handy. Whether drawing, annotating documents, or navigating the interface, the S Pen elevates usability.\n\nRoom for More:\n\nThe MicroSD slot provides an easy way to expand storage if needed. And Samsung Dex transforms the tablet into a portable laptop with the right accessories, a true productivity powerhouse.\n\nMinor Quirks:\n\nThe audio is decent but suffers in portrait mode. The lack of a charger in the box might annoy some, and no cellular option could limit appeal for those on the go.\n\nVerdict:\n\nFor casual and hardcore users like myself, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE is a perfect match. It delivers everything I need and more at an accessible price point. While it may not match the specs of its higher-end siblings, it exceeds expectations in every way.

Inside the box, there is the tablet, the S Pen, a USB-C charging cable, and, oh, some paperwork.\nNow, onto the specs and design. The Galaxy Tab S9 Fe+ looks a lot like the regular version with its aluminium frame, aluminum back, and glass front. It's slim, but this 12.4-inch version is a bit on the heavy side, weighing in at over 600g. The back has the Samsung logo and an 8-megapixel main camera that does 4K video at 30 FPS. Watch out, though—fingerprints show up easily, and you'll be doing some wipe-downs. But hey, it's IP68 water and dust-resistant, so it can handle a bit of splash.\nThe display is where it's at—12.4 inches of LCD goodness. Yeah, it's not AMOLED, but it's still rocking a 90Hz refresh rate. Colours pop, contrast is decent, and the display hits 700 nits. Just don't take it out in the sun too much. The audio comes through stereo speakers, and it's pretty clear and loud.\nRunning on Android 13 (but probably jumping to 14 soon) with One UI 5.1, you get all those Samsung apps. Fingerprint sensor is on the top which is not the greatest, but face detection is there to save the day. I'm digging the split-screen action, too. \nNow, let's talk about the S Pen. You can clip it on the back, and it charges. Double press the button, and you're in the pen menu. It's got the basics covered—note creation, smart select for screenshots, screen write for quick annotations, and even a doodle mode using the front camera. And don't forget DEX mode—it's like turning your tablet into a mini laptop.\nPerformance? It's rocking Samsung's own Exynos 1380 chipset with 12 gigs of RAM. Runs smooth in all modes, even gaming. For Cameras, it has a 8-megapixel normal and 8-megapixel ultra-wide in the rear and an 12-megapixel front cam. Decent for video calls. Battery life is okay with an 10,000mAh battery—about 12 hours on normal use, 8 on heavy use. But charging is limited to 45 Watts, it's not breaking any speed records. Overall a solid tablet but I think the price might be too high for most and with the discounts on the original tab S9, you might be better off getting that version."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have previously been using the Samsung S8 to draw my artwork and designs.

I'm also very happy with the S pen stylus that accompanies the tablet.

The screen is clear and colourful, the sound is exceptional for a Pad and the S-Pen has a mountain of uses.\n\nEasy 10/10 for me.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The samsung tab 9 fe plus really exceeded my expectations, samsung have made the right balance between cost and features without taking away from the tablets great performance, the tablet looks and feels premium in every way.\n\nThe 12.4 inch screen on the FE plus version is super bright (even in an outdoor setting) and produces vivid colours despite the fact it doesn't have an oled display. The 90hz refresh rate makes for a smooth user experience.\n\nThe battery life is perfect! It seems to last forever between charges and easily keeps up with my daily work use, in regards to charging the tablet utilises usb c to charge and a cable is included in the box.\n\nWhilst on the subject of charging.. one thing I would like to point out to anyone planning to purchase the FE, the box includes no charging brick and a usb c to usb cable, so if you haven't got a charging plug with a usb outlet you would be wise to pick one up.\n\nOne feature I didn't know I needed until purchasing this tablet.. reverse charging! With the use of the supplied cable the tablet allows you to plug in any other usb powered device and charge them from the tablets large battery.\n\nPerformance wise the tablet is very capable, whether it's be playing games, watching videos or creating a spreadsheet the tab 9 fe handles them all with ease and I have not noticed any slow down / stuttering. \n\nI love the fact that Samsung includes the S Pen in the box, it really improves the user experience and knowing you don't have to pay more money is great.\n\nI don't often use the cameras on my tablets, however I am really impressed with the quality of both cameras, especially the front camera which in my opinion takes better images than the rear cameras which is a refreshing change.\n\nThe Samsung One ui provides a silky smooth and intuitive user interface allowing many things to be customised, a personal favourite feature of the operating system is DEX mode which in short turns the tablet into a desktop environment with the features you expect from an ordinary laptop, this paired with the Samsung galaxy book cover / keyboard I now find myself leaving the laptop at home.\n\nI highly recommend the Samsung Tab 9 FE Plus! It provides the perfect balance between price and performance."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First thing I noticed when unboxing the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE was how premium it felt. Samsung certainly hasn’t scrimped on the build quality in an effort to keep the price lower as per the mantra of their FE devices - it feels as good as the premium S9 tablet which I also have. The tablet is very thin, feels very sturdy and feels pretty premium with its aluminium and glass build.\n\nThis is the biggest tablet I’ve bought for the purpose of media consumption at 12.4”, and the screen is great for it. Not quite as striking as an OLED but a fairly good LCD with decent black levels, and the 90Hz refresh rate it feels pretty smooth. The stereo speakers on the sides of the device sound reasonable, not tinny or poor quality that you might find on a cheaper tablet. Battery life for watching videos has also been great, and looking forward to testing it more.\n\nThe one area I could tell where the FE does save money is on the processor. There has been a couple times where the tablet has stuttered a bit when launching and running apps, but this didn’t happen often enough to be annoying.\n\nThe included S-Pen is a great extra, and handwriting recognition worked well. I was actually amazed that the pen doesn’t require charging on the back of the device like the one on the premium S9 model… I’m actually a little confused as to how it works as well as the version that needs charged, as it seems to do 95% of the same job!\n\nOverall I’m very impressed with the value for money that you get with this tablet. It strikes a great balance between features that most people would want and use, and the price that you pay.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] on first impressions the unit is very well built and sturdy without being too heavy.\nThe screen is bright and perfect for using on the go outside in daylight,\nand super crisp for text input (the s-pen makes that feel very swish with handwriting to text), the colours are amazing for video consumption too.\nI use tablets and my phone for lots of social media for work, so even with super heavy use i'm getting 2-3 days without the need for a power boost, and when i do, the usb-c chages super fast and im free of the cable again.\nthe speakers and audio are some of the best i've heard on a tablet (and i've had a few)\nall in all this is an epic tablet and samsung have done an amazing job to cram such performance, quality AND battery life into such a thin, and rigid chassis. 10/10 guys\nI will definitely be recommending this and possibly buying one for my mum for her birthday"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a difference since I get my new Samsung Tab S9 FE+.\nMy well used former Tab seems to be so small in comparison to my new daily tool. I am so glad to use the pen also : just imagine how much time we waste cleaning the screen, whereas now I only use the pen.\nOf note, the pen is magnetic to the edges, so that you never loose it.\nThis is definitely a plus benefit when you buy this new Tab.\nI just wonder why I waited so long to buy a larger screen like this tab S9 FE+ : not too big though so nice to watch series !', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have had the Galaxy Tab S9FE+ for just over a week now and so far it hasn't failed to impress, the Samsung smart products experience always starts with nice packaging and this was no different with sleek white boxes and everything neatly packaged. The tablet feels solid and robust with good feel to the buttons and the USB-C charger port is better than previous USB micro versions. The tablet was partially charged upon arrival (54%) but I plugged it in for an initial charge and it fast charged off my existing Samsung charge plug, not too sure if it will Super Fast Charge like my Note phone though.\nThe 12.4 screen is superb, although not AMOLED like the top of the range S9, it is still bright and vibrant with great touch sensitivity and with the included S-Pen it takes some beating. Setting up was easy with the Samsung Smart Things App to transfer some apps and bookmarks from my mobile. I've not seen any lag from running many programs at once and battery life is good even under heavy use although I'm yet to test it out on site for a full day of use. So far there's not a lot to dislike!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very excited  to receive this talent as my laptop was on its last legs and what a great  joy it’s been . I love this product.. It arrived well packaged and undamaged. The box contained everything required though I personally would have liked a plug in charger rather than a cable. The tablet looked  light, stylish  and easy to set up and navigate for novice and slight technophobe like myself. I have only used a computer and laptop before and wasn't sure about a tablet but it,s been a revelation. Th screen is bright and easy to read. I looked at some of my photos which look so much clearer and sharper on this screen. The camera  is excellent quality and absolutely love the E pen with note facility. I feel I am going to love this though have lots to learn. I also feel I have once again a new interest  in using this device rather than resorting  to my phone which I have been  doing because  my  old laptop  was so dated, slow and cumbersome. I’ve already ordered a case and this will travel  everywhere  with from now on ."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tablet really has exceeded my expectations.  After ordering it, I was a little concerned it may be a little too big and I should have gone for the slightly smaller FE, however after using it for a week or so I am so glad I went for the FE+!  This is the FE's bigger brother, and so has a larger screen as well as more RAM, a better camera array and a larger battery.\nWhere to start - well it has to be with the fantastic12.4 inch screen!  It is incredibly bright and with a great refresh rate, it doesn't judder at all.  Samsung have hit the sweet spot when it comes to size, as it is immersive when watching movies or programmes and when playing games, whilst also not being too heavy to hold for extended periods of time. \nThe cameras are brilliant, taking bright, detailed natural looking pictures in both daylight and low light conditions.\nWhen I first setup the tablet I must admit I wasn't sure what the battery life would be like, however after extended use over the past few days, I can confirm it has lasted incredibly well for a tablet with a screen as good as this!\nThe tablet includes the S Pen which wasn't something I thought I would use, however I have found I am using it quite a bit, and after using it regularly, I'm definitely glad it is in the box!\nIf you're thinking of ordering it, but are unsure about its size, and the associated weight or battery life - Don't be, as I have been impressed with all three and am so glad I went for the FE+"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The S9 FE+ is a very well-balanced device. and offers decent value for money. The larger of the two S9 FE siblings, the plus designation brings a bright 12.4"" screen, a RAM and battery boost and an additional ultrawide camera on the rear.  \nBattery life is excellent, and the tablet delivered a great experience with movies (the sound from its stereo speakers is a standout), games and most importantly for me, note taking. \nThe included S-Pen is lovely to use, resistance on the screen is fluid and natural and there is no noticeable lag. Writing to text worked well and enabled me to capture what I needed without having to worry about going back correcting to ensure more accurate translations.  The included note functionality is good, but add in Nebo and you have a portable note powerhouse. \nMy wife has the S7 FE, and this is a worthy upgrade - I love the addition of waterproofing, the only thing missing versus the older tablet is the ability to HDMI out via the USB-C port, which is a shame, but not a dealbreaker as wireless connectivity is offered in abundance. \nSet-up was a breeze and made even more foolproof if you have a Samsung phone (simply scan a QR code and you are off). \nThe S9 FE+ really is a brilliant all-rounder. Samsung has refined its offering to the point that this device does everything well, without unnecessarily overspeccing. \nLightweight, pleasant to hold and use - we will enjoy the avenues this will open in the coming months, including the Pen-Up drawing challenges.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is a fantastic tablet in a very reasonable price range. The display is very amazing and the video quality is superb while playing video games. It has an excellent build quality and a very long battery life. The camera is very good and the best thing about this tablet is that you get  S pen as well. I’m amazed by its touch response.  You can attach it magnetically to the side of the tablet to charge.

This feature is particularly noteworthy for those long work or study sessions, minimizing eye strain and fostering a more comfortable viewing experience. The tablet's display prowess, coupled with its generous size, makes it an ideal canvas for content creation, entertainment, and immersive productivity.

This feature caters to the needs of professionals and creatives alike, eliminating concerns about storage constraints, like most devices impose. If 128GB isn’t enough there are cloud options available, using apps such as DropBox.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus has successfully carved a niche in the market by combining a vibrant and spacious display, an innovative S Pen experience, ample storage capacity, affordability, and long-lasting battery life.

It is a lot thinner than I imagined, but I like that. It comes with a large stylus that feels very comfortable to hold and is magnetic, allowing it to be placed at the bottom of the tablet. Part of me feels like I'd much prefer it to be fitted inside like other Galaxy products; however, time will tell whether I like it more or less. \nIt also has a charging cable, but no adapter plug, so that's something to bear in mind when ordering. \nThe color is nice and subtle. \nNow, on the operational side of things, it was very responsive and the setup took only a few minutes. I could have had my phone data and photos transferred over, but I chose not to as I wanted my tablet to be separate from my phone (for now, anyways).\nThe applications already stored on the tablet are great, with an amazing camera and fun features.

Has face tracking when In teams meetings and camera/mic aren’t bad for a tablet. Screen gets very bright even though it’s not an amoled, I’d put it on par with the iPad Air except with this tablet you get 90hz refresh rate which makes it a bit of a smoother experience.\r\nBasically, if you were considering the tab s7FE because the tab s6 lite was a little too underpowered, I’d say skip the s7FE and get this one instead. Much better.\r\nIf I could’ve changed one thing, it would’ve been for it to have a snapdragon 782g chipset instead.']"

Brilliant size and great quality', 'Very easy to use, this is important as my daughter using it. \r\nNot the quickest but for kids watching videos, playing on it perfect.', ""I bought this in January to replace a 3 year old Alba tablet with Android 10 Go which had a dying battery.  This TCL tablet has much better response to screen touches and the screen has much better contrast for apps such as Google Maps - light green areas showed up white and small roads disappeared on the Alba tablet.  Whether this is a function of Android 10 vs Android 13 or the graphics processors I know not, but I was not able to improve the Alba and the TCL is fine without any adjustment.  I attach a screenshot of the two tablets, the Alba is the upper one. \r\nThe USB C connector is a big improvement over USB B Micro - for a start it goes in either way round, and it also fees more positive when engaged.  I also like the included transparent gel case which gives some reassurance for protection against knocks and has a slightly resilient but not rubbery or slippery feel.  Camera is so-so but I don't use it much.  The twin speakers are clear but a bit shrill and lacking in bass although they give a better soundspread that a single unit, however bluetooth pairing to a speaker or headphones is quick and reliable - once it is paired it stays paired.\r\nBattery life seems to be good - it has about 50% life after several hours web-surfing and playing simple games."", ""I bought this tablet.

There is a sleeve on the back which is providing extra protection - another plus. On setting up, I found it to be really quite intuitive in guiding/steering me through the process which was very helpful as I am not a tech wizard. Screen clarity is really good too.Very quick and easy to connect to broadband. Quick charging but I found the battery lasted very well so this is a big plus for me! I have used it to access the usual suspects such as Facebook, messenger, whatsapp youtube etc and all worked well. I have tried a couple of games and read a book through my kindle app. Searching around the web was easy and accessing my emails was simple too. Overall, I have been impressed by the performance of this tablet and have been using it more than my original one as it is faster and lighter to hold.', 'This is a very good starter tablet.  It came with a protective back case.  I left it to charge overnight and have been doing that ever since.  The start and the volume buttons are easily accessed through the case as they stand fairly proud off the case.  Good for elderly and younger kids.  No fiddling around trying to locate those buttons.  \nIt was easy to set this tablet up.  The typing pad is bigger as show in the photo.  This helps the older generation especially.  It comes with the basic Apps ready installed.  The colours are vibrant and the you tube video runs smoothly. The 32GB memory is sufficient for the basic you tube/mail/shopping application in my opinion.  I did not encounter any issues when using it for those purposes. The wifi search time was not particularly speedy but reasonably acceptable. It does not have a sim slot but I already have a mobile for that so I did not miss it at all. My 69yr old hubby, who does not normally meddle with anything more than a basic mobile phone, took to this tablet almost straight away.  Even took it with him on the weekend away.\nI do not play fancy games on the gadget so cannot comment on how the games would fare on this product. The battery life is not particularly long but it is sufficient for basic use and then an overnight charge to restore life. Represents excellent value for money in my opinion. Works for me :)', 'There’s something exciting about opening a brand new, pristine TCL 10.1, HD tablet. It was well packaged, and all but the foam cover is re-cyclable. The comfortable, clear, plastic, matt cover gives a reassurance that it won’t slip out of your hands. \nSetting up the light weight tablet is made simple by the easy to follow, on screen instructions. Locking choices are PIN, pattern, or face recognition, there isn’t a biometric option, but 3 is plenty.           With the 5G connectivity everything ran smoothly for whatever or wherever I used the TCL tablet for.  Having stereo speakers allows for a more realistic audio experience.                                              The 10-hour battery life means you can take the TCL out and about with you.

With only 32 GB of Ram the micro-SD support allows you to add up to 512GB.\nEverything considered, I’m very pleased with the TCL, well priced Tablet and would recommend it as an entry level or good introduction to newish Tablet users.', ""The TCL Tab 10L Gen 2 Tablet was easy to set up. It came partially charged so I could set it up quickly, linking it to my Google account, before fully charging it to use. The tablet came with a protective bumper case which has proved rather useful. It also came with Android 13 which means it's up to date and very quick. In addition, it has an impressive 32GB internal storage and 3GB of RAM. As well as internal, you can boost the storage with an SD card in the slot provided.This is very good for the size of the tablet and means you can store many apps and photos. The photos attached show the tablet home screen I set up and a picture I have taken of my dog with the tablet's camera. The touchscreen is responsive and easy to navigate around the tablet. There is also a 3.5mm headphone jack so I was able to connect my headphones, which was appreciated as many devices don't come with one anymore.  Overall, this tablet is good value for money. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mid range device to use day to day."", 'This budget tablet is really good value for what you get. It feels sturdy and comes with a back protective case which was a nice surprise. It is average weight for a tablet of its size and the battery has lasted but have only used it for 4 hrs so far. \nInside the box is just the tablet and charger there is no manual but it was really quick and easy to set up - just follow the on screen instructions. \nThe sound quality and picture is good and adequate for what I need but the speed which it changes from program to program is a second slower than what I would have liked but no biggie as like I said just a second slower, the settings are easy to navigate.', ""I couldn't wait for this product to arrive and wasn't disappointed when it did. Discreetly and attractively packaged. On opening the 552g weight (had to pop it on the kitchen scales to check) felt slightly heavier than anticipated, but it's solid and with so many pluses. Here goes... super long battery time after charging. A Few days interval between charges. It's amazing. The colour and graphics are vivid and a joy on the eyes. Stacks of pre-loaded apps and plenty of memory to add more from the Play Store. Set up is the simplest, quickest and most fuss free I've encountered to date. It's designed so you can play with it straight away. Some lovely touches; I totally love the Digital Wellbeing feature that displays how long you've been on the device so you can take a tech break, Eye Comfort modes and so many more assistive features, plus parental controls are great considerations. Comes with a lovely transparent protective silicone case. Ultra transportable, it pops into a variety of my clutch bags no sweat. It really is just a fun little device and so user friendly that a wide demographic of users will enjoy using it."", ""This tablet is one of the fastest I have seen, it came charged to 55%, the instructions read to charge it to 100% first, this done the tablet was switched on and the onscreen instructions followed.I would recommend you sign up for a google account before you start. The setup process took around 40 mins and was very simple, one of the first setup's is WIFI, once done the device starts updating the software in the background so you can continue with setup.You can copy existing apps either from your phone or from a google backup from another device.(all done automatically by answering yes to the relevant setup question). To demonstrate how easy it is to use I gave to an 82 year old to try out and she was able to download and play solitare within minits. Excellent tablet, fast and friendly. Camera was also easy to use ,picture attatched."", 'This tablet is excellent. The screen layout is like a larger version of an android phone. It is easy to set up with your Google account and put all your usual apps on it, just follow the instructions as you would with a phone. The screen is 10.1”, so it is nice and large for surfing the net or reading a book. The screen is also crystal clear and sensitive to touch. It has 32 gb of memory which is good for storing photos, music and videos, and a quad core processor, allowing you to use the apps quickly. It has a card slot for a sim card, allowing to go online while out and about. The card slot for the sim card also allows you to add an SD card to expand your memory. I like that it comes with a clear case. It charges fairly quickly, using the supplied usb c-type charger.', ""I have been using this tablet for a few days now and I am very happy with it. It was easy to set up even though there weren't any detailed instructions. Once turned on it guides you through the process step by step. I linked it to my smartphone via Bluetooth and it copied most of my apps and information from there. It has a lovely clear large screen, my eyesight is not what it used to be so this is so much easier for me to read. I do not play games so can't comment on that aspect, but I find it very good for browsing social media, messaging and online shopping etc. If you have children (or grandchildren) there is a dedicated kids space/zone with parental controls which could be very useful. The battery seems to last well for my usage, after 3 days I still have 67% charge left. It has front and rear cameras which aren't as good quality as my phone camera but are perfectly adequate for a quick snap or video calls/messaging. All in all its a very nice tablet and full of good features."", 'I love this tablet. Easy to set up. Just charge up turn on and follow simple instructions on tablet. Even i could do it and im not a tech head. I must admit it is used mostly as a book handy as its light weight i can read whenever i want but still stay in touch with email ect.. . Photos are ok not the best but good enough to share on social media. Memery is good and can always be expanded with sim. It is a little slow but not that badwith. Overall if you want a basic tablet at a good price then this will do nicely.']"

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra mobile phone. Samsung Galaxy 360 Laptop and a Samsung smart TV hence the reason for purchasing this S9 FE+ tablet. I wanted the new S9 ultra OLED but I couldn't afford it at the time but the S9 ultra OLED is now on sale and with the cash back offer as well as trade in and a free Galaxy 6 watch it makes it a fantastic offer. I would have definitely waited for the S9 Ultra OLED offer if I'd have know as I use my S9FE+ for art work and colouring too so I am disappointed in that aspect but the S9FE+ is still a good tablet. It connects easily to my phone as well as my Samsung TV. In the description it says that it isn't compatible to smart view to a TV but it definitely works on my TV with ease as I can mirror the tablet screen to the TV when we do our online food shopping so my wife can tell me what to add from the comfort of her armchair. It's a pity that my Samsung TV has now come up with a on screen message saying that I now need to buy a newer TV for it to display my Ring cctv cameras. Even though the TV still works fine. This as definitely put me off purchasing Samsung from now on. I changed from owning all A*ple products to Samsung because they forced you to upgrade items to new models by not updating the software for the older equipment (5 years) isn't old and not everyone can afford to keep upgrading. I must admit though if Samsung keep offering the deals to upgrade there technology as they have at present then that's good. The S9 FE Plus tablets is very responsive, good quality display screen even though it's not a AMOLED screen. The sound is very impressive especially when watching 4K UHD on YouTube. I also use the tablet to watch sports TV on my Virgin account and it copes really well but obviously this all depends on the Internet speed. The tablet also makes it easier being able to have finger print recognition for log in and passwords. This is a real bonus for me due to suffering with memory problems. I also have the tablet set to adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambience which it also deals with effortlessly. The smart pen is also easy to use and get used to especially if this isn't the very first experience using a smart pen, if it is your first time, using a smart pen then just practice and it will become se and nature. The smart pen with the FE+ Tablet doesn't have as many options as the Pro pen but I have found it to be enough for my needs. I also purchased a hard silicone protective case with built in screen protector and put the tablet straight in it from new to help keep it safe. You don't have to use a protective case with this tablet as it is dust proof and waterproof but PLEASE READ the details regarding this.

I don’t seem to be able to pair my Sony ear phones though via Bluetooth.', 'Everything its  amazing great product from a great brand highly reccomend', 'Love the tablet, 12.5 screen better than old one and the picture is sharp', 'Great size very easy to use lots of features very good for pictures', 'Great for drawing and notetaking for school but i need help because when i write my screen touches', ""I was a bit apprehensive about this initially but it's got so many features that I find it hard to put down. I think I will be still learning about this for an awful long time"", 'I was looking for a tablet to have around the sofa. I opted for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. Firstly, with a 12.4"" screen, it\'s huge! Akin to carrying a notebook around. But, it fits the bill. Plenty of nice crisp screen real estate and reasonable sound to play with. Just be warned, that - with the sizeable battery, too - it has real heft to it. So far it\'s been great though. Researching from the sofa has never looked so good. The device is slick and looks and feels really premium. The inclusion of the S Pen is great too. Precision and speed. For now, I\'m very pleased indeed.', 'I am on it all the time screen is fantastic for watching TV on 1', 'I love it lots and it is the best samsung device to ever exist!', 'I love my new  Galaxy  tab S9. IT responds much quicker and better all round than my Apple I pad. I can now print from it  which  I could not do with my  I pad.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First Impressions: As a busy professional in my 40s, I'm used to juggling multiple tasks and demanding tech. So, when I got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+, I was immediately impressed by its sleek design and eco-friendly packaging. Ditching the unnecessary bulk felt refreshing, and setting it up with my existing Galaxy S22 via QR code was a breeze – the easiest setup I've ever experienced with any gadget!\n\nPerformance Powerhouse: I primarily use tablets for multitasking, social media, gaming, and browsing. The FE+ tackled everything with ease. I could play GTA3 flawlessly while downloading other games in the background – not a single stutter or lag. It's a multitasking beast! The vibrant 12.4-inch display made everything a joy, from browsing newsfeeds to watching movies. Colors were crisp, viewing angles were generous, and the clarity truly enhanced the visual experience, especially when admiring landscape photos I took with the camera (more on that later!).\n\nS Pen Versatility: Speaking of the S Pen, it's a game-changer! The built-in pen is incredibly versatile, perfect for jotting down notes, sketching, or even editing photos. And the best part? My existing Galaxy S22 pen works seamlessly with the FE+, eliminating the need for extra accessories. This continuity across devices is something I truly appreciate.\n\nCamera Captures Memories: While I wouldn't consider myself a photography enthusiast, the FE+ surprised me with its camera quality. Family portraits and landscape shots came out stunning, with vibrant colors and sharp details. Even zoomed in, the pictures retained their clarity, making it a joy to capture life's moments.\n\nOther Highlights: Battery life has been impressive, easily lasting a full day of moderate use. The speakers deliver decent sound, though stereo speakers would be a welcome upgrade for audiophiles. The software experience is smooth and familiar, thanks to the familiar Samsung interface. And pre-installed apps haven't been intrusive, which is always a plus.\n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is a fantastic tablet for anyone looking for a versatile powerhouse. It excels at multitasking, delivers stunning visuals, and boasts a surprisingly good camera. The S Pen integration and seamless connection to my existing Galaxy phone make it an even more compelling option. If you're a busy professional or someone who simply wants a reliable device"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My experience with Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ has been exceptionally positive from the outset, even before unveiling of the device from the box. I always pay attention to the amount and quality of the packaging. There was no excess of it, all from recycled sources and printed with soy ink and no plastic in sight. Yet the packaging had a quality feel, mirroring the premium feel encapsulated within the tablet itself. Tablet is very slim and light. Its aluminium body feels very premium. The set up process was straightforward, seamless and relatively fast; I managed to transfer all my applications and contacts from my phone using QR code in the process. Very quickly I could access my frequently used apps and download many more. I am very pleased with 128Gb capacity and a possibility of extending it further to 1TB thanks to the memory card slot. \nBoth the tablet and accompanying pen boast water-resistant properties, although I have refrained from putting this feature to the test. I had a little accident with the device when I slipped and fell. It was stored in a thin, temporary sleeve and I thought it might break or at least the screen would crack but nothing like that happened. Since then I am convinced it is a well build, robust piece of tech made to last, reinforcing my confidence in its durability. Nevertheless, a prudent investment in a protective cover has been made to safeguard against potential scratches, mishaps and prolong its lifespan. \nThe screen is bright with vibrant colour reproduction yet my eyes do not get tired. I spend often long hours at the screen editing photos and the fact that this display is designed with reduced blue light emission is very thoughtful. \nThe stylus provided a delightful user experience. Handwriting recognition feature is working great and I had a chance to sign few documents using it. It works perfect in drawing apps, feels natural and reacts differently depending on the pressure variations. Its compact and lightweight design makes it an ideal companion for on-the-go drawing, without compromising on drawing space.  It is fun to use it even with the simplest drawing app, as my usual app for drawing is not available on Android I had to shop around for an alternative. I was successful in finding few and they all were a pleasure to use. \nThe tablet serves as a proficient tool for photo editing, despite its slim profile, the tablet boasts an impressive battery life, further enhancing its appeal.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought a Samsung tablet some years ago, whilst it did it\'s job it never really satisfied, it always felt cramped and didn\'t function quite how it should have done.\n\nSo, the biggest upgrade, the real estate: you wouldn\'t think that an extra 2"" on the screen size would make that much of a difference; if you look at my second photo, you\'ll see that when placed side by side the Tab S9 FE+ doesn\'t look that much larger, but when it\'s in your hands it\'s a night and day difference in the feel. As I already mentioned, my old one felt cramped, the new one just feels wide open, it fills the space in front of your face and your hand is free to roam widely. I know you can get 14"" tablets, but in light of my experience I would say they would probably end up feeling overwhelming.\n\nIf anyone ever had a choice about what size tablet to purchase, I would definitely recommend 12"" as the perfect place to settle on.\n\nNow, performance, unless you\'re running extremely demanding apps you generally won\'t notice problems, I can say the S9 FE+ definitely felt more responsive over my old one, but that was more a subjective feeling. What I did know was that the S9 FE+ was happily running some games that my old one couldn\'t, despite it technically being specced up enough, again, see my second photo showing the S9 FE+ actually playing Crying Suns whilst the other only has a message saying it\'s not capable.\n\nAnother performance improvement, connectivity with other devices, in this case connecting to my Samsung Galaxy Book 3 laptop, see my third photo: the old tablet was meant to function as a second screen, but it would only do so after enabling a hidden developer menu function. Every. Time. The S9 FE+, however, actually showed up when my laptop scanned for external devices and connected seamlessly, just a single click with the mouse; it also benefitted from the larger screen size, the higher resolution, and no lag when moving the mouse cursor across on to it. It will actually prove to be usable for this function, whether as an expanded screen or as a duplicate for someone to observe what\'s being displayed on my laptop.\n\nLastly, sound output is a definite bump up from my old tablet, though a slight nitpick that my fingers tend to end up sitting over the speaker grilles... However, the quality and volume is immersive, a nice surround effect enveloping your head, you know it\'s powerful when your fingers start vibrating when you stick them in the wrong place!\n\nUpgrade Recommended!!!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We have been looking for a new tablet for a while as our old one was just that, old, and a bit clunky so this is a great replacement for us. \n\nInitial impressions upon opening the box are that its really sleek looking. Super thin and streamlined and even comes in a box slim enough to fit through the letterbox (although to achieve that it does mean that no charger plug comes in the box which is a big negative mark for me considering the pricepoint) \n\nThe screen on this tablet is huge! And super clear with bright vivid colours and high definition images. Very impressive and runs films/TV well as well as making more standard stuff like games, notes, spreadsheets super clear. \nWe also tested it with a few super high res clips (2060p) and it handled that pretty well even despite a bit of lagging. \n\nI was most excited about the S pen feature as we are currently planning a wedding and thought this would be brilliant for taking notes and all the plans we are making, and the S pen does not disappoint.... Mostly. \nI have found that it can be rather glitchy and one some apps (such as the play store) you can't use it at all so this is the main reason I can't give the tab 5 stars. I have also experienced issue swith it while using sheets, particularly when trying to write text in cells instead of numbers. \nIts a big selling point in all the media releases and i feel it's just a little too glitchy and could do with some improvements and polishing - hopefully that will come in future updates. \nIt is satisfying to use though and still my favourite feature of the tablet. \n\nOverall this is a really nice tablet. Its a brilliant size with the 14 inch screen yet is lightweight and slim so doesnt feel too chunky and still feels portable. \nIt is absolutely a perfect upgrade foem our old android tablet and were rwally enjoying putting it through its paces and exploring all of the features. \n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new tablet, especially if they use it a lot for watching videos/fims/shows ect."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ 256GB arrived in a super slim white flat box along with the S Pen, a USB type C charging cable and pin for opening the SD memory card slot. First impression was how slim the tablet was which did mean that there is nowhere to stow the pen unlike my old tablet (A minor issue to be honest).\n\nAfter charging I set about setting up the tablet with my existing Google account credentials. I decided to copy the apps and settings from my Samsung Galaxy S20+ phone rather than my old tablet as my old tablet contained mostly outdated and limited apps.  Using the Samsung Smart Switch app on both my S20+ phone and the Tab S9 FE+, the transfer of all my apps, files and photos was simple and straightforward. However, it did take a little while due to the considerable number of photos and videos to transfer but that was only to be expected. On completion all my apps and photos were copied over and ready to use. With 256GB of storage space there is ample capacity for my purposes and I imagine for most other people too, but if not then there is an SD memory card slot for even more storage.\n\nBattery life has been very good and lasts me for days. You need to provide your own charger which is disappointing but seems to be the norm these days. I don\'t have a high power USB C charger so haven\'t been able to test the quick charging function. However, I usually just plug it in overnight and it\'s 100% full by the morning.\n\nMy primary use is for watching videos and social media. The picture quality of the 12.4"" screen and sound quality are excellent, way better than my old tablet. The touch screen is sensitive and accurate as you would expect. I am looking forward to making use of the S Pen for drawing and note taking. It turns out that the pen with my previous tablet also works with the new Tab S9 FE+ so that\'s a bonus if the pen is ever lost.\n\nThe power button doubles up as the fingerprint sensor making it very convenient to use. Much easier than entering a PIN or drawing a pattern although those options are also available.\n\nI bought a protective case and applied a screen protector to fend off any knocks and scrapes which with the best will in the world are inevitable at some point.\n\nOverall I am delighted with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ and it has been a very overdue upgrade of my old tablet. Hopefully it will last me for a good few years to come.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Setting up was painless from my Galaxy S23. Connecting the two with a USB cable and a scan of a QR code and my software was duplicated.\n\nA recent update to One UI 6.0 makes it more like having a super sized phone, as the tablet can make calls / SMS through my linked phone.\n\nThe screen admittedly is not OLED, but still very good – 12.4”, bright and vibrant - then again the full-fat Tab S9 is twice the price.\n\nThe option to add a microSD memory card up to 1TB is great.\n\nSome have complained about problems multitasking, but as it is a tablet - I only usually run one App at a time and it excels.\n\nStreaming video and music is great as the speakers are very good and it’s IP68 water and dust resistant.\n\nI’ve been making use of the PENUP software to rekindle my interest in art, which works surprising well.\n\nBattery life is very good. Using a 45W charger (not included) it take about an for a full charge. I don’t really need to keep checking it, as it’s generally still has 50% charge when I think of topping up.\n\nNo headphone jack, but you could always buy a USB-C to headphone convertor.\nHandwriting recognition is good feature, to convert to text or even dial a number from one you have written on the screen.\n\nAll in all, a great mid-spec tablet, which beats all the entry level competition and punches above its weight – to challenge the best in class. It’s also a great companion for a Samsung smartphone improving the experience of reading digital media and streaming content.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having owned one of the earlier model first Samsung tablets, which I was using up until quite recently, I was amazed  what a different beast Samsung now has to offer.  Samsung's technology, graphics and just as important sound capabitiies have progressed so much in such a short time.\n\nThe overall sophisticated feel and look of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is of quality and sleek styling. The tablet was extremely easy to set up once out of the stylish packaging and pretty much guided you through the whole process from start to finish.  \n\nCharging time is extremely quick but would have liked it to hold its charge a little longer than it did. I found it made more sense turning the tab off completely when not in use to save from charging it so often.\n\nOnce setup, it was very easy finding my way around, especially when adding apps and setting up my emails.  The graphics were outstanding and the 12.4 inch screen was great to surf the net with but particularly came into it's own when watching movies.  The colours, quality and sound could rival most high end television brands yet alone rival tablets!  I've never felt the urge to watch movies on anything other than my main TV but since owning the tablet it has been great to have the additional option.\n\nThe tablet has been a useful tool for my university note taking and creating sketches with the handy S Pen.  Far cleaner than scrappy bits of paper which were easily mislaid.\n\nThe unit also has a slot for an SD card which is a handy feature for obtaining additional memory. Slight disappointment when I found I could not use headphones as no place to insert them so will need to purchase Bluetooth ones. \n\nI highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ for work, pleasure and that all important college / university work."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was looking for a tablet that excels in the everyday essentials, without breaking the bank.

The aluminum casing oozes quality, and adding the S Pen is a delightful bonus.

Videos play with stunning clarity, vibrant colors, and crisp sound from the dual speakers. The processor easily handles everything I throw at it, from casual browsing to online shopping, with zero lag or stuttering. Battery life is a major win, lasting significantly longer than I need between charges.\n\nS Pen Magic:\n\nThe included S Pen adds a whole new dimension to the experience. Jotting down notes in Samsung Notes is smooth and natural, and the magnetic attachment keeps it handy. Whether drawing, annotating documents, or navigating the interface, the S Pen elevates usability.\n\nRoom for More:\n\nThe MicroSD slot provides an easy way to expand storage if needed. And Samsung Dex transforms the tablet into a portable laptop with the right accessories, a true productivity powerhouse.\n\nMinor Quirks:\n\nThe audio is decent but suffers in portrait mode. The lack of a charger in the box might annoy some, and no cellular option could limit appeal for those on the go.\n\nVerdict:\n\nFor casual and hardcore users like myself, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE is a perfect match. It delivers everything I need and more at an accessible price point. While it may not match the specs of its higher-end siblings, it exceeds expectations in every way.

Inside the box, there is the tablet, the S Pen, a USB-C charging cable, and, oh, some paperwork.\nNow, onto the specs and design. The Galaxy Tab S9 Fe+ looks a lot like the regular version with its aluminium frame, aluminum back, and glass front. It's slim, but this 12.4-inch version is a bit on the heavy side, weighing in at over 600g. The back has the Samsung logo and an 8-megapixel main camera that does 4K video at 30 FPS. Watch out, though—fingerprints show up easily, and you'll be doing some wipe-downs. But hey, it's IP68 water and dust-resistant, so it can handle a bit of splash.\nThe display is where it's at—12.4 inches of LCD goodness. Yeah, it's not AMOLED, but it's still rocking a 90Hz refresh rate. Colours pop, contrast is decent, and the display hits 700 nits. Just don't take it out in the sun too much. The audio comes through stereo speakers, and it's pretty clear and loud.\nRunning on Android 13 (but probably jumping to 14 soon) with One UI 5.1, you get all those Samsung apps. Fingerprint sensor is on the top which is not the greatest, but face detection is there to save the day. I'm digging the split-screen action, too. \nNow, let's talk about the S Pen. You can clip it on the back, and it charges. Double press the button, and you're in the pen menu. It's got the basics covered—note creation, smart select for screenshots, screen write for quick annotations, and even a doodle mode using the front camera. And don't forget DEX mode—it's like turning your tablet into a mini laptop.\nPerformance? It's rocking Samsung's own Exynos 1380 chipset with 12 gigs of RAM. Runs smooth in all modes, even gaming. For Cameras, it has a 8-megapixel normal and 8-megapixel ultra-wide in the rear and an 12-megapixel front cam. Decent for video calls. Battery life is okay with an 10,000mAh battery—about 12 hours on normal use, 8 on heavy use. But charging is limited to 45 Watts, it's not breaking any speed records. Overall a solid tablet but I think the price might be too high for most and with the discounts on the original tab S9, you might be better off getting that version."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have previously been using the Samsung S8 to draw my artwork and designs.

I'm also very happy with the S pen stylus that accompanies the tablet. Previously I have had many a problem with a stylus and that is the key reason that I use a tablet.\n\nYou can also add a MicroSD card so you are not clogging up the working memory on the tablet and risk it being slow or laggy.

(I have been reviewing my notes on the train which has saved me time and not trying to dig out my note book - which i no longer carry)\n\nAlso unlike my old Pad, this has fingerprint recognition on the ""On Button"" which is a nice feature.  Now my screen is locked and I dont have to worry about someone looking over my shoulder to access my pad.\n\nPut simply this Pad is amazing.  The screen is clear and colourful, the sound is exceptional for a Pad and the S-Pen has a mountain of uses.\n\nEasy 10/10 for me.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The samsung tab 9 fe plus really exceeded my expectations, samsung have made the right balance between cost and features without taking away from the tablets great performance, the tablet looks and feels premium in every way.\n\nThe 12.4 inch screen on the FE plus version is super bright (even in an outdoor setting) and produces vivid colours despite the fact it doesn't have an oled display. The 90hz refresh rate makes for a smooth user experience.\n\nThe battery life is perfect! It seems to last forever between charges and easily keeps up with my daily work use, in regards to charging the tablet utilises usb c to charge and a cable is included in the box.\n\nWhilst on the subject of charging.. one thing I would like to point out to anyone planning to purchase the FE, the box includes no charging brick and a usb c to usb cable, so if you haven't got a charging plug with a usb outlet you would be wise to pick one up.\n\nOne feature I didn't know I needed until purchasing this tablet.. reverse charging! With the use of the supplied cable the tablet allows you to plug in any other usb powered device and charge them from the tablets large battery.\n\nPerformance wise the tablet is very capable, whether it's be playing games, watching videos or creating a spreadsheet the tab 9 fe handles them all with ease and I have not noticed any slow down / stuttering. \n\nI love the fact that Samsung includes the S Pen in the box, it really improves the user experience and knowing you don't have to pay more money is great.\n\nI don't often use the cameras on my tablets, however I am really impressed with the quality of both cameras, especially the front camera which in my opinion takes better images than the rear cameras which is a refreshing change.\n\nThe Samsung One ui provides a silky smooth and intuitive user interface allowing many things to be customised, a personal favourite feature of the operating system is DEX mode which in short turns the tablet into a desktop environment with the features you expect from an ordinary laptop, this paired with the Samsung galaxy book cover / keyboard I now find myself leaving the laptop at home.\n\nI highly recommend the Samsung Tab 9 FE Plus! It provides the perfect balance between price and performance."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First thing I noticed when unboxing the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE was how premium it felt. Samsung certainly hasn’t scrimped on the build quality in an effort to keep the price lower as per the mantra of their FE devices - it feels as good as the premium S9 tablet which I also have. The tablet is very thin, feels very sturdy and feels pretty premium with its aluminium and glass build.\n\nThis is the biggest tablet I’ve bought for the purpose of media consumption at 12.4”, and the screen is great for it. Not quite as striking as an OLED but a fairly good LCD with decent black levels, and the 90Hz refresh rate it feels pretty smooth. The stereo speakers on the sides of the device sound reasonable, not tinny or poor quality that you might find on a cheaper tablet. Battery life for watching videos has also been great, and looking forward to testing it more.\n\nThe one area I could tell where the FE does save money is on the processor. There has been a couple times where the tablet has stuttered a bit when launching and running apps, but this didn’t happen often enough to be annoying.\n\nThe included S-Pen is a great extra, and handwriting recognition worked well. I was actually amazed that the pen doesn’t require charging on the back of the device like the one on the premium S9 model… I’m actually a little confused as to how it works as well as the version that needs charged, as it seems to do 95% of the same job!\n\nOverall I’m very impressed with the value for money that you get with this tablet. It strikes a great balance between features that most people would want and use, and the price that you pay.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] on first impressions the unit is very well built and sturdy without being too heavy.\nThe screen is bright and perfect for using on the go outside in daylight,\nand super crisp for text input (the s-pen makes that feel very swish with handwriting to text), the colours are amazing for video consumption too.\nI use tablets and my phone for lots of social media for work, so even with super heavy use i'm getting 2-3 days without the need for a power boost, and when i do, the usb-c chages super fast and im free of the cable again.\nthe speakers and audio are some of the best i've heard on a tablet (and i've had a few)\nall in all this is an epic tablet and samsung have done an amazing job to cram such performance, quality AND battery life into such a thin, and rigid chassis. 10/10 guys\nI will definitely be recommending this and possibly buying one for my mum for her birthday"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a difference since I get my new Samsung Tab S9 FE+.\nMy well used former Tab seems to be so small in comparison to my new daily tool. I am so glad to use the pen also : just imagine how much time we waste cleaning the screen, whereas now I only use the pen.\nOf note, the pen is magnetic to the edges, so that you never loose it.\nThis is definitely a plus benefit when you buy this new Tab.\nI just wonder why I waited so long to buy a larger screen like this tab S9 FE+ : not too big though so nice to watch series !', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have had the Galaxy Tab S9FE+ for just over a week now and so far it hasn't failed to impress, the Samsung smart products experience always starts with nice packaging and this was no different with sleek white boxes and everything neatly packaged. The tablet feels solid and robust with good feel to the buttons and the USB-C charger port is better than previous USB micro versions. The tablet was partially charged upon arrival (54%) but I plugged it in for an initial charge and it fast charged off my existing Samsung charge plug, not too sure if it will Super Fast Charge like my Note phone though.\nThe 12.4 screen is superb, although not AMOLED like the top of the range S9, it is still bright and vibrant with great touch sensitivity and with the included S-Pen it takes some beating. Setting up was easy with the Samsung Smart Things App to transfer some apps and bookmarks from my mobile. I've not seen any lag from running many programs at once and battery life is good even under heavy use although I'm yet to test it out on site for a full day of use. So far there's not a lot to dislike!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very excited  to receive this talent as my laptop was on its last legs and what a great  joy it’s been . I love this product.. It arrived well packaged and undamaged. The box contained everything required though I personally would have liked a plug in charger rather than a cable. The tablet looked  light, stylish  and easy to set up and navigate for novice and slight technophobe like myself. I have only used a computer and laptop before and wasn't sure about a tablet but it,s been a revelation. Th screen is bright and easy to read. I looked at some of my photos which look so much clearer and sharper on this screen. The camera  is excellent quality and absolutely love the E pen with note facility. I feel I am going to love this though have lots to learn. I also feel I have once again a new interest  in using this device rather than resorting  to my phone which I have been  doing because  my  old laptop  was so dated, slow and cumbersome. I’ve already ordered a case and this will travel  everywhere  with from now on ."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tablet really has exceeded my expectations.  After ordering it, I was a little concerned it may be a little too big and I should have gone for the slightly smaller FE, however after using it for a week or so I am so glad I went for the FE+!  This is the FE's bigger brother, and so has a larger screen as well as more RAM, a better camera array and a larger battery.\nWhere to start - well it has to be with the fantastic12.4 inch screen!  It is incredibly bright and with a great refresh rate, it doesn't judder at all.  Samsung have hit the sweet spot when it comes to size, as it is immersive when watching movies or programmes and when playing games, whilst also not being too heavy to hold for extended periods of time. \nThe cameras are brilliant, taking bright, detailed natural looking pictures in both daylight and low light conditions.\nWhen I first setup the tablet I must admit I wasn't sure what the battery life would be like, however after extended use over the past few days, I can confirm it has lasted incredibly well for a tablet with a screen as good as this!\nThe tablet includes the S Pen which wasn't something I thought I would use, however I have found I am using it quite a bit, and after using it regularly, I'm definitely glad it is in the box!\nIf you're thinking of ordering it, but are unsure about its size, and the associated weight or battery life - Don't be, as I have been impressed with all three and am so glad I went for the FE+"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The S9 FE+ is a very well-balanced device. and offers decent value for money. The larger of the two S9 FE siblings, the plus designation brings a bright 12.4"" screen, a RAM and battery boost and an additional ultrawide camera on the rear.  \nBattery life is excellent, and the tablet delivered a great experience with movies (the sound from its stereo speakers is a standout), games and most importantly for me, note taking. \nThe included S-Pen is lovely to use, resistance on the screen is fluid and natural and there is no noticeable lag. Writing to text worked well and enabled me to capture what I needed without having to worry about going back correcting to ensure more accurate translations.  The included note functionality is good, but add in Nebo and you have a portable note powerhouse. \nMy wife has the S7 FE, and this is a worthy upgrade - I love the addition of waterproofing, the only thing missing versus the older tablet is the ability to HDMI out via the USB-C port, which is a shame, but not a dealbreaker as wireless connectivity is offered in abundance. \nSet-up was a breeze and made even more foolproof if you have a Samsung phone (simply scan a QR code and you are off). \nThe S9 FE+ really is a brilliant all-rounder. Samsung has refined its offering to the point that this device does everything well, without unnecessarily overspeccing. \nLightweight, pleasant to hold and use - we will enjoy the avenues this will open in the coming months, including the Pen-Up drawing challenges.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is a fantastic tablet in a very reasonable price range.

It is a lot thinner than I imagined, but I like that. It comes with a large stylus that feels very comfortable to hold and is magnetic, allowing it to be placed at the bottom of the tablet. Part of me feels like I'd much prefer it to be fitted inside like other Galaxy products; however, time will tell whether I like it more or less. \nIt also has a charging cable, but no adapter plug, so that's something to bear in mind when ordering. \nThe color is nice and subtle. \nNow, on the operational side of things, it was very responsive and the setup took only a few minutes.

Quite large so note the dimensions. Fingerprint reader doesn't work.  The reader on its predecessor, a Tab P10, only worked intermittently though was convenient when it did work. This seems to be a pattern. My previous two Lenovo tablets had vanilla Android installations, so worked like budget Pixel tablets. This P12 has some extra layers on top of Android which I'm still learning my way round.

It works the other way around (as an available option), where I can default to pen input and quickly switch to touch keyboard input if required. The handwriting conversion is something I'm still trying to use effectively - it doesn't seem to like my handwriting style, so currently entering text on touch-keyboard is faster.

TOOK 30 MINS TO GO FROM 50% TO ALMOST 90% ON BATTERY USING 20W CHARGER', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you’re interested in buying a high-end Android tablet this year, Samsung is making your decision easier than ever\nThe Galaxy Tab S9 tablets has 11 inch screen, is slim, has a great battery life with a killer AMOLED panel.\n\nCompared to last year’s Tab S8 lineup, there are two tangible upgrades in the S9s: a new Qualcomm processor that promises to be a little faster and IP68 water and dust resistance, which means you can use these tablets around a pool or bathtub without panicking about water getting on the pad\n\nWater resistance isn’t something you’ll find on any iPad, but all three Tab S9 models have it, Also If you already have other Samsun’s items,the Tab S9 share the same software as the phones so you can easily pass files between devices, respond to text messages from your tablet, or use the same apps across both. \n\nAlso with gorgeous OLED displays and great speakers. Movies, TV shows, and games all look and sound great on them, all Tab S9\ncome with the (now also water-resistant) SPen stylus in the box but you will have to pay extra for keyboard and any other accessories.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] From being a user who used the Tab S7 and the Tab S8 tablets, opening up the Tab S9, setting it up and using it, I was blown away. The tablet is super fast and you can tell a massive difference with the snapdragon processor. The tablet has no lagging at all when playing games like Fortnite. \n\nThe 120hz screen is amazing and everything is so clear. The tablet is light and powerful and feels very sturdy in the hand. I went for the beige colour which really does stand out. The sound quality is also amazing. Crystal clear sound when gaming or watching a video.\n\nI have not been able to use the S pen as of yet, so can't comment on how good it is.\n\nI would recommend this tablet for anyone wanting a powerful tablet. Even though the Tab S9 is the entry level tablet, you cant tell it is an entry level tablet due to the spec and how powerful it is."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got the Samsung S9 smallest size which to me feels like the perfect size to be able to be portable, multi task and enjoy media content on the go! And wow was I right. The sleekness design, slim metal borders and S Pen, easy to use perfect weight. It is the ultimate device. the multi tasking apps works so perfectly, there's no lag. I used the note pad to write down a list for back to school shopping, and it automatically converted my hand written messy writing to perfect typed sentences, with no spelling mistakes! And then to relax and watch a clip online wow the speakers are perfect which go well with the OLED screen. Dolby Atmos. Overall I am super happy with this device and cannot wait to take it on a long travel with me!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is a high-end Android tablet delivering powerful performance and premium engineering. It features a slim metal and glass design weighing just 1.5 pounds with a brilliant 11-inch Super AMOLED display. With deep blacks, excellent contrast and reduced blue light; this screen delivers fantastic visuals for every day use. Processing power comes from a cutting edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip with up to 12GB RAM for seamless multitasking, photo editing and gaming. The S-pen is great for quickly making notes on the go; annotating PDFs and even sketching! Ample battery life provides all-day usage and fast charging support helps rejuvenate quickly. Ideal for working on-the-go', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow, what a tablet. As soon as I opened it, it looked amazing. I did think there was something missing as the packaging was so slim. It turns out that it does not have a wall charger (A bit annoying as its supposed to be a fast charge tablet and all mines are regular).Shame as you\'d expect the fast charger to be included at this sort of price point. Additionally, it does not have a 3.5mm audio connector for headphones, so I\'ll have to rely on wireless headphones. I prefer the wired option as its one less thing to charge and they are not as easy to lose! \n\nI had an old Samsung S6 Tab Lite which was getting on a bit. I transferred the data from my tablet to the new one. It was quick and easy, although wireless presented some connection problems, in the end I opted to transfer using usb-c to usb-c cable. Once it had finished, almost everything was transferred. Whatsapp and the Microsoft Launcher being the only things that I had to do something manually to get them going..\n\nThe screen is absolutely stunning, everything looks super HD on it. AMOLED screens are excellent at producing high contrast and true black and saving power at the same time. The overall performance of the tablet is blistering, everything I run on it is super fast. \n\nThe sound is amazing too, there are 4 speakers on this tablet. They pump out a lot of sound. Its difficult to believe that the sound is coming from the tablet! I watch YouTube videos on my 24"" Samsung TV. The sound coming from the S9 tablet is easily as loud with noticeably increased bass. \n\nAll in all, this is a very easy tablet to love. Solidly built with excellent performance in the audio and visual departments. I don\'t use my tablets for work/productivity, but I\'m sure its more than capable on that front too (It has more memory than my desktop PC and a newer processor). There is DEX mode to put the tablet into desktop mode which is really useful if you want to use it for work tasks.\n\nTiny niggle Samsung, for the price, please include the fast charger, 3.5mm jack and a protective case to make it perfect.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung has fast become my go to brand for anything tech related as I have never been disappointed. I have been using the Tab S9 WIFI 256BG in beige and I haven\'t been off it since as it has quickly replaced my previous tablet as my day to day tablet. \nThe tablet itself is stunning with a large 11"" crystal clear screen, perfect for watching films or TV shows, or being used as a laptop when combined with a keyboard. Despite its large size this tablet is incredibly lightweight, thin and easy to carry around. Everything runs smoothly with no lagging thanks to the 120 Hz refresh rate.\nThe tablet uses Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 to power it making it one of the fastest on the market. This makes the Tab 9 powerful enough to support any app and games. This tablet also comes with a stylus pen, known as the S pen. This is particularly useful for quickly jotting down notes, which can be saved as is or the tablet can convert handwriting into text form. When not in use the S pen can be stored at the back of the tablet via magnets.  \nOverall I am very impressed with the Tab S9 and once again Samsung has made a fantastic product that is well worth it and much better then others on the market.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tab S9 is a stunning Android tablet.\n\nStraight out of the box, you can sense the quality, with the metal body feeling super high end in the hand.\n\nThe weight is perfect, be it using it during the day or lyign in bed for media consumption. The AMOLED screen is so vibrant and satisfying, meaning watching anything feels immersive extra enjoyable. The 120Hz refresh rate makes the whole experience so smooth and responsive.\n\nThe fact that the S-Pen is included in the box is excellent. Using it is so satisfying be it for work, signing documents or even using it as a drawing tool for my son to enjoy and stay busy when out and about. Combine all this with the keyboard cover and you have a device that is really well ahead in the Android tablet world.\n\nA wonderful device that really shows Samsung in a great light.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Tab S9 is a highly anticipated tablet that has received a lot of attention leading up to its release. As a reviewer, I had the opportunity to test out this tablet and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.\n\nFirstly, the design of the Tab S9 is sleek and modern. It has slim bezels and a large screen, providing an immersive viewing experience. The display itself is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp detail. Whether you're watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, everything looks great on this tablet.\n\nThe performance of the Tab S9 is top-notch. It is powered by a powerful processor and ample amount of RAM, allowing for seamless multitasking and smooth performance. I tested out various apps and games, and everything ran effortlessly. The tablet also has a large battery capacity, so you can use it for extended periods without worrying about running out of power.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Tab S9 is its S Pen. This stylus offers precise control and allows for creative freedom. Whether you're taking notes, drawing, or editing photos, the S Pen provides a natural and intuitive experience. Additionally, the Tab S9 has a built-in storage slot for the S Pen, so you don't have to worry about losing it.\n\nThe Tab S9 also offers a great audio experience, thanks to its quad speakers. The sound is clear and immersive, making it ideal for watching movies or listening to music without needing to use headphones.\n\nOn the software side, the Tab S9 runs on Samsung's One UI, which is smooth and user-friendly. It also supports DeX mode, which transforms the tablet into a desktop-like experience when connected to a keyboard and mouse. This is a convenient feature for productivity tasks.\n\nIn terms of connectivity, the Tab S9 offers Wi-Fi and optional 5G capabilities, so you can stay connected wherever you go. It also has a USB-C port for fast charging and data transfer.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Tab S9 is a fantastic tablet that offers a premium experience. It has a beautiful display, powerful performance, and a great stylus. Whether you're using it for work, entertainment, or creative purposes, the Tab S9 is a versatile and reliable device."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tab S9 series is setting the benchmark for what Android tablets can do. The tablet is built like a tank, but is lightweight and portable, making it really comfortable for extended one-handed use. The S Pen is intuitive and lag-free, especially its air actions. I love that I can control volume and switch between music tracks just by holding the button and waving the S Pen around. I don't even need to be near the tablet to make it work. It's fantastic!\n\nAs expected, performance is excellent. I love being able to split apps across windows and have a floating app when I need it. What's particularly useful is being able to easily use the Tab S9 as a second screen for my laptop - no wires or setup needed. Performance isn't just good for work, though. I paired the Tab S9 with a Bluetooth controller and have been playing games on the tablet itself and using it for remote play on my PlayStation 4. Everything works flawlessly and there's never any lag or connection problems.\n\nPlus, everything just looks amazing on that display! It's bright, vivid, and super smooth, whether you're scrolling through webpages, playing games, or watching movies. The quad-speaker setup is also excellent; the sound is loud and clear, and the bass packs a powerful punch. It's perfect for watching media or playing video games.\n\nAs for the cameras, I didn't think I'd like them as much as I do. The front camera is super wide, which is excellent for video calls and getting lots of people in view without having the tablet far away. And the camera on the back is great for scanning documents and taking pictures that you can mark up with the S Pen. The microphones also do a solid job of focusing on my voice and minimising background noise whenever I'm on a call.\n\nOverall, I'm really impressed by the Tab S9 and can easily see it replacing my laptop as my main computer!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] as expected, another great tablet from Samsung. Crystal clear screen with beautiful vivid colours. Great sound from such a small product. it was super easy to set up and to copy everything across from my other Samsung tablet - it prompts every step of the way so that even those who are not tech savvy will manage it. \nThe settings tab allows you to personalise it, so if large bold fancy font is your thing, just press the setting and save. it is fast to load on startup. there are lots of usefull apps pre installed to get you started and plenty more on galaxy store and play store.the S pen attaches itself to the back with an inbuilt magnet and begins to charge as soon as it connects to the back.\nIt is very easy to connect other products wirelessly, eg wifi printers, bluetooth speakers. By following a few easy steps. You can sent documents to your printer to print. \nConnecting it to a Samsung keyboard and allow the Samsung DeX setting then your lovely little tablet will become a little laptop. \nThere are several options for your choice of search engine.  Its lightweight enough for you to comfortably hold it in one hand when browsing your social media.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tablet has well and truly come of age. What was once seen as a somewhat hobbled computing experience can now offer something akin to laptop-like computing while still delivering a great viewing experience whether watching a movie or playing a game.\n\nIf you’re invested in the Android eco-system and are looking for a portable device with some serious grunt then this year’s Galaxy Tab S9 range has to be top of your list for consideration - available in S9, S9+ and S9Ultra variants rocking 11in, 12.4in or 14.6in screens respectively. You can opt for WiFi-only or 5G connectivity and storage options from 128GB to 1TB.\n\nI took the S9 with 256GB of storage for a spin and even at this comparatively low-end of the range was seriously impressed by the power and smooth operation. This version retailed for £899 at time of review (drawing rough parity with the pricepoints from last year’s S8 range). Some retailers are offering trade-in and the Slim Book Cover keyboard thrown in to sweeten the deal.\n\nUpgrades this time around mean AMOLED 2x screens across the range, with the S9 featuring a dynamically switching refresh rate and eye comfort baked in with a 16:10 aspect ratio. Elsewhere you’ll find an upgraded processor (an overclocked Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2), bigger quad speakers featuring Dolby Atoms, IP68 and improved dust and water resistance. \n\nThe Tab S9 body is reinforced with Armour Aluminium and the range is available in two colours: Beige and Graphite.  The inclusion of the S Pen stylus which a magnet can hold neatly in place on the rear of the device is truly transformative. Professional creators can also opt for a S Pen with a material design and wider tilt angel. The fact I’m still using a Tab S3 regularly is testament to just how useful it is as both an input device and the ability to parse scrawl to text makes this ideal for notes. \n\nMulti Window, DeX, and Second Screen functions make this a pleasure to use if you’re looking for a laptop-like device and the inclusion of GoodNotes for note taking and LumaFusion for video editing add to the creative possibilities.\n13Mp rear and 12Mp front cameras (with ultrawide cams on the + and Ultra) allow for the communicative possibilities we’ve come to expect while battery sizes are between 8400mAh and 11,200mAh making it possible to hit the road and power your day fairly successfully.\n\nAll in all, if you’re looking for a portable computing device that delivers stunning entertainment, plays nicely with other An', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This s9 256gb wifi product arrived in a thin box slightly deeper than the tablet itself. \n\nIt comes with \nTablet itself\nA usb c charger wire\nWarranty manual and details\nNew style s pen in colour matching tablet\npin to extract the sim card slot for micro sd.\n\nFirst thoughts are its a good size diagonally and depth which make it easy to hold. The aluminium feel feels very sturdy and the screen bezel is about 1cm so you have most of the tablet size as usable screen real estate.\n\nIt utilises android as an os so is very similar to android phone users meaning little to no difficulty switching to this device.\n\nThe setup process allows easy transfer drom a different device and made transfer easy. For image purposes, the new device setup was just as easy and it guides you through a linear process.\n\nThe pen feels sturdy and connects well to the device, the responsiveness for basic use and notes was highly efficient so im sure it would be fine with more finicky tasks like drawing albeit I didnt test this.\n\nI tested this briefly by dipping it in the sink and it is still responsive with the pen, finger not so much. I wouldn't trust it for prolonged use in water but using in the bath and having that accidental drop shouldn't phase it. If you wish for more intense water use, i would advise a waterproof case for that extra layer of protection.\n\nI personally really liked the device and its responsiveness is very similar to the galaxy book range.\n\nI would recommend id you want a nice quality item with a high premium feel then this is for you, i do however feel it is a pricey device but it definitely feels the price value to quality for this price range a product.\n\nThe waterproof feature is a new publish for tablets so if you want the latest and greatest, look no further."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I took the Samsung Tab S9 for a spin to see how the latest Android tablet fares in comparison to the competition out there. The S9 is the smallest of the new tablet offerings from Samsung at 11”, with the S9+ and S9 Ultra also available at 12.4” and 14.6” (!) screens respectively. \n\nThankfully Samsung hasn’t sacrificed specs as you go down in sizes (which some manufacturers are guilty of doing), with all three having the same screen tech, processor, camera module (the bigger tablets have additional lenses but the main sensor is the same across the range) and water/dust resistance, so I didn’t feel like I compromised the experience by choosing the smallest of the three flavours.\n\nFirstly the Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is incredible. Movies and photos look stunning with deep blacks and colours that really pop. The refresh rate maxes out at 120Hz so everything feels really fluid when in use. Compared to other top end tablets from other manufacturers out there, I’d say this is the best tablet screen you can buy on the market right now.\n\nPerformance is equally impressive with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on board. The dock function at the bottom of the screen allows you to switch between apps instantly and I was impressed with how instant the apps responded after switching between them, with little to no lag perceivable.\n\nThe other feature that has impressed me is the inclusion of the S Pen that snaps on the back of the tablet so that a) you don’t lose it and b) it charges the pen when not in use. I intend to use the tablet as a note taking device with an upcoming course I’m enrolled in, as the handwriting and note taking ability is excellent.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use my tablet mainly for reading, web browsing and online shopping. Also content consumption i.e. youtube, netflix etc and a little bit of light gaming. The majority of this is done at home either on the sofa or in bed and as such I find the smaller of the three S9 range of tablets to be most suited to my particular use case. The device feels extremely well built having a solid feel in hand. It looks and feels impossibly thin whilst at the same being comfortable to hold in hand and use. The screen has great colour reproduction and high resolution/HDR content from either youtube or Netflix looked amazing on this tablet, and for such a small device the sound from it was a pleasant surprise. I'm not really much of an artist but I let my daughter try her hand at creating an artistic masterpiece to test out the pen capability which was easy to setup and use. There's plenty of options in the settings to configure exactly for my requirements and I was happy to see options to cast content from the device to a larger screen wirelessly. I will continue to use this device as a companion to my smart phone as the two devices also seem well optimised to work well with one another. Overall I'm suitably impressed and still can't get over over thin and light it is!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having owned both the Tab S6 and Tab S7, I knew what to expect but the Tab S9 has exceeded all expectations. The design is very sleek and easy on the eye. It's very fast, with an amazing display (seems a significant improvement). I've always like the Android interface and it's easy to customise the home screens with any number of widgets. Transferring data from previous tablets was very straightforward. The sound is fantastic, particularly with Dolby Atmos enabled. The  S-pen makes accurate writing and drawing incredibly easy. This is a step up from previous models and another win for Samsung!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first decent tablet. When it arrived it came in a nice sturdy box.  In the box was the tablet, charging lead , stylus pen and a pin.  The first thing to know is there is no plug and the charging cable is a C-connection at both ends. Once charged I switched on. Instantly the graphics is noticeably sharp and clear. Setting up the system was easy enough to follow and I was able to Smart share apps and info from my phone onto to the tablet.  My main use would be for reading emails, internet searching and playing games. The s pen is charged by being attached to the back of the tab which takes roughly an hour. The pen is fun to use, you are able to write to text, scrolling and general indication.  The speed of page loading and movement is great.  This is a very neat stylish tablet with great capacity and imaging. Far handier for transporting than a laptop. I was able to get a case to put it in.  Connecting a keyboard would be a smart move if typing was a big necessity.  I know there's plenty more for me to find out about the Tab9 but what I've seen so far has been worth the money. Great quality, slender, light and jazzy."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my third Samsung Galaxy tab and definitely the best one so far, it has far exceeded my expectations. I mainly use the tablet for emails, browsing, shopping and streaming videos.\nThe screen resolution is absolutely fantastic, a big step up from my previous model in my opinion. It has made a big difference to my viewing experience when streaming video content. The sound quality is also premium. It doesn't have a headphone jack, but I found it really easy to connect it to my wireless headphones. \nIt comes with an S-pen, which attaches easily to the tablet for convenient access. I will probably rarely have the need to use it, but it's a handy accessory to have.\nI found it really easy to transfer content over to this one from my previous tablet and sync it with my Galaxy phone. \nThe tablet is very thin, light and sleek, giving the appearance of a premium product.\nThe battery life, so far, is great, it appears to be a significant improvement to my previous tablet, although I have had that for a while now. With reasonable use, it will last me significantly longer than my previous model, this is a great bonus for me. \nIt's very responsive, quick and easy to navigate. If you are familiar with Samsung Galaxy products, then you will find the settings quite easy to use and tailor to your preference. \nIf you have access to a keyboard, it's really easy to convert it into a mini-laptop for light office work etc. \nOverall, I am really pleased with my purchase and I am sure I will get plenty of quality use out of it for quite some time to come. Highly recommended."", 'I bought this for my Husbands birthday and he is thrilled with it.

To have so much screen and processing power in such a thin and light device is awesome. The drawbacks are minor, but un-ignorable:\n\nThe screen has a seemingly lower pixel density than an iPad. The apps look slightly fuzzy edged on the home screen and things can look a bit blown out, it\'s minor but present. \n\nThe S-pen nib has worn down to almost nothing fairly quickly. As I only use it for hobby art this is disappointing. \n\nAnd perhaps the biggest offence, is how easily the screen scratches, omg! It\'s so so soft. Loads of small scratches and scuffs on the edges and some in the middle of the screen. Considering I barely take it out the house and is mostly used for media and drawing, this is a real shame. My iPad lasted for years with barely a minor scuff, yet this is already looking worn. I also suspect that the keyboard case has contributed to the scratching! \n\nSo overall, it is a great bit of kit, but these minor drawbacks stop it from being top tier. I\'d say if you\'re using it to travel a lot and it\'ll be in and out of bags etc, get something more durable. But if you can look past the annoying issues, and you\'ll mostly be using this in a ""safe"" environment, you won\'t be disappointed by its productivity and performance! \n\nOh and one last thing.

With Samsung Dex mode and the keyboard cover it works just like a laptop so your getting the best of both worlds. Not to mention that New Dex is also reqlly cool. The screen is huge and gorgeous plus the sound is great and it's super fast. I won't go into all the specs since you can look those up. But if your debating on wether to get a tablet or a laptop then the Samsung S9 Ultra is for you since it's a tablet but then when you put it in Dex mode and add either the keyboard cover or a Bluetooth keyboard it becomes just like a laptop with a windows style layout and the ability to open multiple windows and resize, minimize and maximize them and the Octacore Snapdragon 8 Gen2 chip has plenty of power for it to be on par with most laptops I'd say it's even more powerful than most laptops in this price range. Also you get 12gb of ram standard and 16gb of ram if you buy the 1tb version. I got the Samsung S9 Ultra 512gb and it's a beast. Oh and it has a powerful graphics chip too that will run very high end games up to 240fps with real time ray tracing which wasn't introduced on consoles until the PS5 and Xbox X and the Nintendo Switch doesn't support ray tracing.so if your looking for a powerhouse tablet with a huge beautiful screen, plenty of ram and 256gb, 512gb or 1tb of memory plus the ability to accept a 1tb Micro SD card for extra storage plus the ability to act as a laptop then look no further!

Once I finally figured out how to get the stand down on the cover it is brilliant.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As an owner of both the Tab S7+ and the Tab S8 Ultra it's clear to see the family resemblance. The hardware is solidly built and with the muscle to back up the looks. If you are already invested in the Samsung ecosystem you will be pleased with how nice everything plays with each other, going from your phone to tablet can be quite a delight at times. The screen evolution from the S8 to S9 is quite nice, with the extra framerate the S9 can feel more buttery smooth. The power of chipset in the S9 can be felt over the S8. Generally I would say going from the S7 to S9 is a no brainer but if you are an owner of the S8 I don't know I could recommend the upgrade. Samsung are the only name in town when it comes to premium android tablets. \n\nI've always been a fan of the spen, I remember holding out on bying my first tablet until one came out with a stylus and wouldn't you know it, it ended up being Samsung with their note tablet, I'm pretty sure I still have it in a drawer somewhere out of nostalgia. Samsung have been at this from the very beginning of tablets coming to market and I'm glad they have continued to inovate as the went because I couldn't imagine myself being happy with the alternatives. The fact that Samsung includes the spen and don't force you to buy it separately tells you a lot about the company. \n\nThe Tab S9 Ultra is excellent for media consumption with its screen and speakers, I don't really game on android devices but I can feel with the gen 2 chipset there is a ton of headroom available if that is a path you wish to follow, I have seen that emulation and cloud gaming is becoming quite popular and services like game pass will make you love this little beauty. Just pair a controller and be sure you have a solid Internet connection, you will find yourself with an extremely portable gaming system."", 'Bought this and its Amazing, the best item I got', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Opening the box felt like a premium experience and I was surprised at how thin and light the tablet is in person. Despite this being the Ultra, I can safely say that it doesn't feel overly big although it's definitely designed for landscape use primarily. The screen resolution is sharp and bright, and speakers really do pack a punch - quite surprising in that you would have expected a more tinny sound from such a thin device! The magnetic snap on of the pen is a nice touch, and it has a good weight and texture when writing on the screen - very responsive and natural - as you would expect paying for this premium device. Applications are snappy to load and the DEX experience really does give this a laptop feel for those wanting a more familiar desktop experience. You can't help but compare with other premium tablets that this competes against. The differentiator is often down to the quality of applications available, but I can safely say that the hardware here is definitely on-par in a lot of areas if not better - camera, screen, audio and overall snappiness make this a delight to pick up. The change in form factor takes a bit to adjust to, but consumers planning to use this as a work/home device will welcome the advantage of the wider landscape screen estate to work with.\nHaving owned several android tablets, I've always found that the overall longevity starts to wane after 6 months, and that a lot of the marketing gimmicks fade away. This could still be the case, but right now the first impressions are highly positive - and would struggle to find a reason why this device can't last a good 12+ months. \n\nIt is hard to justify going for this device if you are budget constrained, and feel that a tablet-esque laptop will be more suitable, with the flexibility of a full OS to maximise productivity. \n\nIf you want the best android tablet experience, then the instant on with top end hardware (underscreen fingerprint scanner, face recognition log-in, S-Pen, 120hz OLED screen) combined with  Samsung's  additional software wizardry through DEX and their ONEUI clean interface will certainly give keep you grinning every time you whip it out.."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra WiFi was purchased after a great deal of comparison and contemplation regarding my burgeoning need for a high end portable technology upgrade. The impressive advertised performance and efficiency specifications plus brand reputation persuaded me despite what does seem to be a high new to market price. However, smartly boxed with an exquisitely minimalist design finish, it does also come with an extended warranty plus a long pre-installed software support period alongside much hyped next generation improvements including an adapted S-pen. Having versed myself with the official specifications and with expectations of so many promised bells and whistles, I can happily state that after a thorough period of testing most claims do seem to impressively hold true!\n\nI feel that a 45w wall charger should crucially have been included to utilise it\'s USB-C cable allowing the battery to be charged optimally despite it lasting very well over many full day\'s use. I was also frustrated by the lack of a basic physical start up guide but eventually discovered a thorough user manual link in it\'s settings which would have saved a lot of wasted time including \'powering off\' which is actually defined within the proprietary BUSBY App which has many attributable settings and acts akin to Google or Alexa too. These sort of things seem to be presumed knowledge by Samsung but are a hindrance to new users unfortunately!\n\nOn the flip side ""Samsung Quickshare"" immediately made moving files between old devices and this a breeze. \nThe manual guided me to many exclusive apps {with others that I\'m still investigating} but everything hints at an excellent expanse of customisation and versatile functionality within what is a surprisingly durable feeling compact (5.5mm), yet manageably light (732gm) massive 14.6"" display tablet. To my understanding the ""strong as armour aluminium frame and S-pen dust & water resistant IP68 rating"" is also a first and adds to it\'s future proof design alongside the fact that despite having 512gb internal storage it allows expansion by upto 1tb via microSD so a whole library of media and documents might be contained!\n\nWith the addition of a folding ""Bookcover"" keyboard plus software named ""DeX"" this transforms the tablet into acting just like windows does. For personal and small business use I believe this combination might well offer a replacement to using laptops, especially mobile, but more thorough testing would be needed to best understand if this is the case for heavier office use, plus the fold didn\'t keep the weight of the tablet in place and flopped over without counter balance sadly. For this reason I suggest it would be advantageous for said item to be included in the purchase especially as it safely secures the tablet and pen within, and without this cover the S-pen simply magnetizes against the tablet\'s rear compared to being integrated within the tablet housing, which would be an improvement in my opinion, along with it being fully closeable with a carry handle for superior protection. \n\nFor me the S-pen ""air commands"", pressure sensitive functionality, precision and ""handwriting to text"" ability appears second to none and was the deciding factor in my purchase allowing amazing note-taking and creativity, plus instantaneous shared collaboration and brainstorming presentations via the impressive set of Apps it works with. Handwriting takes a little practice to reduce transcription mistakes but the tips sensitivity allows for enhancing documents and some serious artistry! It\'s a shame that ""Goodnotes"" is only provided for the first year with prescription after, but I would be interested to see if the advertised extra detachable ""Notepaper"" like transparent screen would make up for this with a more realistic experience? The upgraded AMOLED display maintains a vivid range of colours, contrasts and a crisp and clear lifelike dynamic set of screen hues and depth which in direct sun can still be very well seen, plus the \'Zoom in\' functions great without any adverse pixelation. The Snapdragon processor meant that everything functions fast and smoothly even when utilising the (upto 3) multitasking split screen windows simultaneously or its numerous connectivity abilities, whilst quickly switching between Apps, and has exceeded my expectations with such impressive top tier media consumption and performance!\n\nThere is a built in ""Samsung TV"" app with extensive viewing options and of course many other (varieties of) apps could be easily installed, however I found altering video playback qualities difficult in these, and realised that camera video capture although 4k was only 30 frames per second despite playback nominally being 60fms which is subtle but noticeable. Having a set 16:10 aspect ratio also detracted from what having a 4:3 option would have improved. To be honest apart from the additional \'wide angle\' feature I feel the camera quality is too homogenous despite ample editing modes, but then being so large this model probably isn\'t intended by most to act as a prime camera tool. The sound quality although \'loud\' seems to lack richer definition and base frequencies, plus I found the speaker position muffled by being held on occasion, but otherwise the quad speakers and display proficiency as a result meant I thoroughly enjoyed an Immersive audio cinematic experience. \n\nThere is a 5G model but with all the modern sharing and connecting capabilities this tablet can utilise I felt the WiFi model would suffice for my more personal home use, however having the pleasure of owning it I would actually recommend any more serious or professional user to opt for 5G enabling realistic foreseeable future proofing. \n\nFor creative and/or editing usage, or a versatile home studio or office I believe this might well become the new standard for innovative premium products despite the higher price. Whether it can be classed as a laptop replacement in terms of productivity for heavier use is open to debate but it certainly gives the versatility of carrying less weight around without the struggles of a smaller screen. In conclusion this is ultimately a high spec intelligently engineered next generation Android tablet with a myriad of functions and features which stands up and even out from other comparable devices whilst providing an exceptionally enjoyable experience for todays digital lifestyles!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Im thrilled with this new Samsung ultra S9 tablet. \nDespite me being a Samsung fan and love their products this has taken me by surprise in its new fantastic features. \nI dont normally purchase the higher spec and sit around the middle. This time am thrilled to have purchased this. \nThe features are great, its light\nAnd feels great. \nGoing to love exploring the features over the next feew weeks. \nThe addition of the keyboard with it really enhances the experience of it. The pen being magnetic if great but the slot in the keyboard means its safe and easily accessible.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The thing that really struck me was the weight. SUPER lightweight. You literally would think there's a mobile phone in the box instead of a tablet. The design is  sleek and flawless, and the little pen it comes with is really handy if you have fumbly fingers \nIt really is aesthetically pleasing too!\nThe speed of the tablet is great when it's loading content and I have had no issues with it.\nSince its an android, I am very familiar with the layout etc so I really liked that I wasn't struggling to get accustomed to it.\nI like that you can connect it to a keyboard so it makes it a lot easier for those who struggle with the touchscreen\nI personally don't mind using it either way but maybe in the future for those who want to use it with a keyboard, I would suggest Samsung add some sort of clip things to it so it makes the keyboard more stable \nI would 100% recommend this to anyone who is interested in investing in a tablet as it really delivers minus the bulky weight."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Prior to buying the Tab S9 Ultra, I had the basic Tab S8, which I was happy with. Upon opening the Tab S9 Ultra, I was blown away by how light it is, despite its larger size compared to the Tab S8!\n\nFrom opening the box to having it setup and my data from the Tab S8 transferred took around 10 minutes using the handy built in Smart Switch app, literally a child could do it so great for those not too tech savvy. \n\nThe screen is vibrant, with very vivid colours and the speakers are a huge improvement! Music sounds as it should, and it handles movies with ease. \n\nIt looks beautiful without a case, however I do use a case when out and about just for added protection, although it does look like a sturdy piece of kit!\n\nThe battery life is perfect for daily use, and has lasted me around 3 or 4 days between charges with pretty frequent use, making it ideal for when I am on the go.

The S Pen works seamlessly and is very responsive and has pinpoint accuracy. \n\nThe tablet can also serve to function as a laptop replacement by using Samsung's Dex app/feature. It converts the tablet into a typical computer type experience. The mode itself is very responsive and has been very useful. Although it does not have the full elements of a PC type experience, it is very close and can easily become a replacement for a laptop. The Dex mode starts (and closes) instantly and brings up everything you had open. What helps with this is the keyboard case that the tablet came with, however this is not standard and was part of a bonus offer.

The processor is fast so I can quickly switch between apps.\n\n The camera quality is very good compared to other tablets I've owned- No more blurry photos. \n\nI love the S pen that's included it's great for taking notes and drawing. My daughter loves drawing with it and me and my eldest is it for note taking. It charges magnetically on the tablet. \n\nIt takes a SIM card and is unlocked to any network so you can take it out and still get online. The 3 year warranty is excellent peace of mind too and ive never came across such a generous warranty before."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have always enjoyed using Samsung products and needing a new tablet for mobile photo editing and display the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra was the logical choice given it's specifications.\n\nThe tablet is light and has an excellent vivid and bright high resolution display which makes it a pleasure to work with whilst on the move.\n\nSamsung really has thought of it all with Dex also which allows also to control the table from your pc/ laptop.  It is easy to use and also allows for easy file transfers.  This gives you best of both worlds of your software on your pc/ laptop and apps on your tablet which is so useful!\n\nAn added bonus is that I can use it as a second screen/monitor wirelessly with my laptop as well as transfer files between the tablet and laptop without any need for cables or via the cloud.  This has just really helped with my productivity as well as when transferring lots of photos.  You can just leave your laptop on the desk/table and move to the sofa and continue to work!\n\nThis is where the Samsung Pen really comes into great effect as it is very responsive and the writing recognition to text is very accurate and fast such that you do not need to use the on screen keyboard of a physical keyboard if you don’t wish to.  Art and drawing is easy and accurate.  Whilst it attaches well to the back magnetically it is not a nice sleek integration as if with the phones which would have been nice.  Charging it is fuss free and wireless which is such a great feature!\n\nWhen it comes to displaying photos or videos, the display comes into its own with great colour reproduction and detail such that clients are impressed there and then rather than having to wait to see on a larger monitor.\n\nWhen not doing work, playing games is great and performance is great, but not only that watching high-resolution movies is fantastic and immersive!  The sound coming from the speakers is fabulous and really immersive also!  Yes the kids love it also! :D\n\nWith the ability to connect external hard drives or increase the storage with a micro usb card the Galaxy Tab 9 Ultra really is a powerhouse of portable productivity and entertainment without the need to be hooked up with any wires!\n\nOverall I cannot have asked for a better tablet to complement or should I say nearly replace my laptop for productivity and entertainment!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I ended up going for the larger ""ultra"" version of the S9 tablet and I was not dissapointed! I use the device a lot for content consumption and also in my work as a hairdresser for booking in clients for appointments and ordering of stock online. The large screen makes watching video\'s and showing my clients different hairstyles on youtube and facebook a breeze, the quality of the screen also is something to behold! I still can\'t get over how impossibly thin and light the device is given the hardware it packs inside. It\'s been fast and fluid and a joy to use in everyday tasks. I was impressed with the various different options for unlocking and securing the device and the process for adding my face and finger print was was really easy to do. Also the speakers on the tablet also really took me by surprise, they were clear and loud and made watching video\'s and listening to music really enjoyable. My partner has a high end PC and was even able to connect this tablet via a docking station via the USB-C connection and output the image to a larger screen, as such I\'m sure that I could even replace my normal laptop with this tablet and remove the need for having to carry 2 devices and replace it with just this one. all in all I\'ve been really happy with this purchase and would have no hesitation recommending this tablet to others.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Historically my allegiances have been with other brands, but I was always looking for the opportunity to move over to Android and Samsung devices.  Already having a number of other Samsung products in the house, the S9 Ultra was the right size, specification and looks to replace my current tablet.  However with a premium tablet came a premium price that that need a bit more consideration.\n\nAfter the wow factor from unboxing this very aesthetically pleasing, armour aluminium ultra slim tablet and powering it up, the 14.6"" 120hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X display supporting HDR 10+ is amazing and vivid. Photos and movies come to life - combined nicely with large quad speakers featuring Dolby Atmos support.\n\nThe big screen screen also helps with multitasking allowing you to have up to 3 applications open on the screen.  The display is clear and crisp with lovely colour saturation.  I\'ve also used it as an extension to my laptop at work, and found the the integration just worked seamlessly.  12GB memory seems to be more than enough for smooth performance, and if you really need to add extra storage, there is a microSD card slot to add up to 1TB of extra storage.\n\nBased on the size and performance of the screen - I was expecting some impact on the battery life, however it is excellent - lasting at least a day with reasonable use.\n\nThe cameras, 13mp and 8 mp dual rear camera and 12 mp ultra wide on the front are impressive and do a good job.  All of the cameras can record video up to 4k resolution and 6 fps.  Please note that big hands maybe required to take photos with this tablet!\n\nThe S Pen feels nice and subtantial, easy to use and responsive.  Unfortunately I\'m no artist, but my wife was impressed with her inital testing.  The S Pen can also write in search bars, browser and the appstore.\n\nA few nice touches I havent tested yet including an IP68 rating for those mishaps in the bath, and other mishaps with dust!  According to the certification - it will survive near or underwater and S Pen will write on the screen!\n\nIts a shame it does not come with some sort of case or protection, as this is essential for a tablet this big.  I got the Book Cover Keyboard which is also a very useful practical accessory.\n\nFinishing off with some technical stats:\nPerformance and battery life\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy\n12GB memory with 256GB (my version)\nMicroSD card up to 1TB\n11,200mAh\n16 hours of usage on a full charge', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've given the Tab S9 Ultra a good break-in recently, and I think it can't be understated just how large the display is. It looks and feels like you're using a typical laptop, with the added flexibility of multiple keyboard and cover types, stylus support, decent palm rejection for note taking, and a crazy-good display for any-conditions use.\n\nI picked up the slim keyboard cover to really unlock my productivity, which has added a new dimension of use for the tablet.\n\nBut, it isn't cheap. For the form factor you really do need to ask if Samsung's OneUI Android flavour is really as useful as other desktop operating systems.. and not just the OS itself, but app compatibility too. Android apps are very clearly *not* built for tablets of this size, some not for tablets at all, and that really takes away from the experience. \n\nI'm also not as blown away by the aspect ratio. For a productivity monster of this size, the 16:9 widescreen aspect is a little restrictive, and it'd be more versatile with something closer to 4:3.\n\nOverall for working on the go and media consumption it's a great device. The battery life supports it well. I was tempted to go for the SIM-enabled version on the basis I've always done so out of necessity, but the Android ecosystem is mature enough now that cross-device connectivity is just not a concern. \n\nBased on durability reviews I've seen, as well as the water resistance, it seems like it'll stand up well to the trials and tribulations of working on the go, though I'm not too keen on testing that theory myself!\n\nI like it, and most of all I finally get to use an Android tablet that doesn't feel like I have to struggle with a small screen if I want to leave my laptop at home."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After getting delivery of the tablet it was clear from the size of the box that this was going to be something special and out of the ordinary when it comes to tablets. Upon opening it up you\'re greeted with a 14"" screen and high quality metal.  Inside there box it is simply the tablet, a USB C lead, a tray eject tool (for Micro SD cards) and the paperwork.  No power brick included, but I\'m sure we all have a lot of those laying around.\n \nOn powering up the first thing you notice is the brightness of the screen the pure white Samsung wording piercing through the OLED blacks looks great. Another thing is that this tablet is no slouch, it\'s quickly booted and in to setup mode. This is the standard Android affair of logging in with your Google account and choosing to transfer data if you so wish etc. Once this was done and WiFi was connected I was off and running, installing my most used apps.\n\nDue to the size of this device I\'d certainly recommend a stand or case with a kickstand, it\'s quite hard to hold, although the thinness ensures that it\'s not heavy at all. The supplied pen snaps to the back to charge displaying a indicator that it\'s attached and powering back up.  I\'ve not had much chance to put the pen through its paces as I\'m not really artistically inclined, but my daughter no doubt will do. Early usage seems that it was nicely weighted and accurate in its tracking.\n\n Another aspect which really makes use of the power and sheer size of the screen is Samsung DeX. Turning this tablet in to what is pretty much a 14"" Chromebook with the press of a button, the OS takes on a more familiar desktop feel with resizable windows and a start style menu.  Whilst in this mode I tested it and it had no issues running 2 spreadsheets in Excel, a 4K movie in Plex and also running a Remote Play window for gaming on my console.  Another surprise to me was how easy it was to use the tablet as a second screen in Windows. Simply go to settings to turn on and then on your PC search wireless displays and that\'s it, simple. No cables required and worked perfectly.\n\nBattery life seems really good on this too, having watched a good 3-4 hours of media on Plex, the bright HDR OLED screen and powerful speakers make this a standout feature and usage for this device. I was still presented with around 80% battery, a couple hours of gaming and still well over 60% \n\nOverall this is a great tablet for those that want the best and enjoy consuming media but it\'s not cheap.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The first thing to note is the size, its massive at 14.6"". Upon unboxing, it feels premium in the hand but sturdy at the same time, its thin and quite light considering its size. The screen is amazing, the colours are so vibrant and the clarity make it an immersive experience. It is extremely fast and responsive due to the new Snapdragon processor and multitasking is a breeze. The battery life is also excellent, it easily lasts the day with fairly heavy usage, which includes watching videos, playing games and general internet/app use.  Streaming, watching films and playing games is a joy due to the quality of the screen and the power the tablet possess. Connecting the tablet with other devices I have is effortless and the S Pen is a useful addition for taking notes and drawing, but I probably won\'t use it as much as some others will. All in all, I can\'t really find anything negative to say other than maybe the price. I would definitely recommend.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] A tablet that can truly replace your laptop. The 14.6-inch tablet is Samsung's Flagship product capable of handling most if not all power-consuming, professional tasks. I’ve been testing the Samsung Galaxy Tab Ultra for few days now, and I've found it to be a pretty multi task device, though, like all consumer electronics, it's not without its few drawbacks. \nS Pen included in the box, which is a very nice touch as other competitors make you spend additional money if you want a stylus pen. Which is very handy specially if for professional task?\n\nPros\n+Samsung multitasking is better than other competitors\n+Improved Dynamic AMOLED display\n+Huge, cinematic screen\n+Gorgeous display and blazing performance\n+Very good speakers as a tablet point of view\n+Smooth 120Hz display\n+Ultra responsive S Pen\n+IP68 water and dust resistant\n\nCons\n--Faster charging would have been nice\n-Colours could be more natural\n-Performance with headphones not very outstanding\n-Not easy S Pen storage\n-Bit Pricy"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really love this tablet, its a full fledged computer if you can just add a keyboard and all the apps works great. I had an old keyboard and it connected with bluetooth easily. The UI is very fast and smooth same as their mobile devices. If you have a samsung mobile, you will also love this tablet. \n\nThe screen size and resolution is huge, this device has a lot of room for all the apps. If you want to use multiple apps at the same time, you can do it easily. You can install many apps from the store including but not limited to education, streaming services, games and many more. The apps that are available on mobile are all available for tablets too.\n\nThe battery timing is quite good with many hours to work and watch movies. WIth good battery comes good screen quality and good pen control which is very slick and when working with a designing app, the pen writing and drawing is very quick.\n\nOverall the best things I liked are the design, pen smoothness and tons of apps to use. Highly recommended ot everyone.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was taken aback when I received the Samsung Tab Ultra 9. It came beautifully boxed with the tablet, pen, charger, and instructions. The tab screen size was more significant than I expected, it exceeded my expectations. It is light and thin. I love that the pen is magnetic and charges while connected rather than separate charging. The tab was easy to set up and the display is amazing - high resolution and high quality. The tablet is premium and the battery life is good. The cameras take high-quality pictures and videos. The storage options are great and you can add more if required. I have noticed that 5G was not picked up on the tab so that was a letdown. The S pen can lose its connection when using colouring and drawing apps. Also having to buy a plug separately is a letdown and if you want a keyboard then you have to purchase this separately too even though a hefty price is paif for the Tab initially. The main thing I did not like is if I use certain apps, their screen size stays the same and does not optimise the large screen size of the tab. This was a big disadvantage and if you are in landscape mode some apps can only be used in portrait mode. Overall I do love the Samsung Tab S9 Ultra and would recommend to family and friends but the ad pop ups and business of the screens on some pages are a let down compared to other tablets available.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Tab S9 Ultra tablet is a remarkable device that elevates the tablet experience. Its stunning AMOLED display boasts rich colors and deep blacks, perfect for media consumption and productivity tasks. The powerful chipset ensures smooth multitasking and gaming performance. The S Pen support enhances creativity and productivity, while the long-lasting battery keeps you going all day. However, it's essential to note that its size may not be for everyone, making it less portable than smaller tablets. If you prioritize a large, immersive screen and top-notch performance, the Tab S9 Ultra is an excellent choice. \n\nFirst turning on the tablet initial impressions are WOW! It's a Samsung, the best TV/Phone/Monitor producers on the planet and as expected the screen quality on this tablet is insane being equipped with the latest version of Samsung's AMOLED display. Bright, huge with vivid colours and very thin bevels. This thing is basically all screen and a very very high quality one at that!\n\nI'd recommend this tablet to a really wide audience, despite it coming with the S Pen included which may make you think it's just for creatives/artists who would value being able to draw directly on the screen without the need for a seperate graphics tablet. For travellers, the very high quality screen and sound output means you have your very own high quality cinema when on a plane or train. Likewise for business use the large high quality screen would be perfect for giving presentations."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For a 14.6 inch tablet the S9 Ultra is surprisingly light but really sturdy.  The construction definitely has a premium feel due to the metal frame even though it is only 5.5mm thick.  The weight is well balanced and feels light to use.\nThe S Pen is easy to use and proves really useful for lists and annotating documents/spreadsheets whilst also coming in handy for drawing rough plans for my garden.\nThe screen is simply amazing, the 2960x1848 AMOLED screen really makes colours pop with pictures of Nebulas looking particularly good due to the contrast and detail of that AMOLED screen.   Films are immersive and sports looks smooth due to the 120Hz refresh rate, the screen size is also brilliant for reading magazines whilst also scrolling through news feeds or web pages.\nThere is so much to mention about this fantastic tablet, the capacity is great and can even be expanded using the micro sd slot, all in all, Samsung have surpassed themselves with the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra 512gb.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] From the very first use of my new tablet I was very impressed, I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never owned a Samsung tablet before. All of my other devices are Samsung so I was really looking forward to seeing how they all interacted with each other, and how simple it would be to transfer files to my other devices. I was amazed at how simple it was to set the Tab S9 Ultra up, due to all of my accounts/settings being saved on my phone all I had to do was press a few buttons and everything just appeared and was all ready to go. I decided to attach the slim book cover to see how it worked and was really surprised at how easy it was to use, the magnetic attachments simply click in to place and the tablet is secure. It also makes it a lot easier having the physical keyboard when doing a lot of typing. One of the features I was most excited about was the S pen, I've always enjoyed drawing/designing so couldn't wait to try the pen. I love how the pen has so many features and it just feels so easy to draw with and allows you to be very precise. The screen is exceptional quality and very responsive, I've looked through my photos/videos that I've taken on my S21 ultra and the colours look so vivid and the details look so sharp. I can't wait to try out all of the other features,  but so far the Tab S9 Ultra has really exceeded my expectations."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This has a gorgeous 14.6-inch OLED display, an ultra-slim modern design, and, a great processor which comes in the form of the Snapdragon 8 CPU.\n\nWhat I like.\nI like the fact that you can pair a keyboard with this, which makes it like using a laptop. A officially keyboard is a must have for me, to use this, because of its size.\nI'm actually suprised how sturdy this is, but also how thin it is\nVery pleasantly suprised.\n\nThis also has an SD card port for expansion.\n\nThe display is simply gorgeous, the OLED combined with 102mhz refresh rate makes this more than ideal for gaming, and, watching movies.\nColours are really sharp and extremely crisp.\n\nWhat I don't like\nThis does not have a 3.5mm headphone port, which is a shame, especially for watching media late night.\nI would have thought that this could have been an important consideration even designing a tablet such as this.\nThe S Pen that comes with the tab does not show directly into the tablet.\nInstead this uses magnets to hold the pen, which doesn’t work very well. A very easy way to lose the pen, which is a shame as it would have been much more secure to be able to store the pen inside the tablet.\n\n\nOverall conclusions\n\nIf you want this tablet for productivity it's an absolute powerhouse.\nIt made editing my photos using lightroom a breeze.\nI'm also a typical user who likes to keep too many tabs open when browsing and/or researching.\nI detected no slowdown at all when browsing, even with multiple tabs open.\nIf you want a modern, stylish tablet with huge processing power, then I would highly recommend this."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my Tab S9 Ultra a few weeks ago. It has greatly increased my productivity and has been a wonderful addition to my workspace. It syncs perfectly with my Fold 5, and provides ample room for my work. The 14.6 inch display is beautifully crisp, perfect for graphic design, and is amazing to watch videos on. The included S-Pen handily snaps onto the rear of the tablet, and is incredibly useful and easy to use. I am overall incredibly impressed with this tablet, it truly is a cut above the rest', 'I had inadvertently connected this to my laptop docking station which had 2 x 27"" screens linked.\nI could not work out why the screens had powered up, then I realised that it was my tablet being connected that caused it to happen. To my pleasant surprise I was able to use the S9 like a laptop and do all the normal laptop work using the external keyboard and mouse that was also connected to the docking station.\nNo need now to purchase a laptop for my business needs. The S9 does what Samsung advertisers- it can be a replacement for a laptop.', 'Recieved today with the pre order, works like a beast really fast and cant wait to use it more!']"

It's definitely recommended by me!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been a Samsung Tab user for years, normally the regular size, but this time I decided to go for the plus, as I wanted something I could potentially take in place of my laptop. I bought the slim AI keyboard for this and I'm not disappointed! It's compact, attaches magnetically and takes the table to the next level. It's a real productivity machine, great for video calls, mega battery life and all the things you'd expect from a Samsung tablet like excellent performance and a top notch screen. I loved the anti glare screen on the S24 Ultra and it's just as good on the S10 range. Completely recommended for similar use cases!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Tab S10+ arrived in a solid box with a charging lead (no plug) and a S pen. With a 12.4' screen it is a very good size for having on your lap and for carry around.  Once fully charged it was easy enough to set up. The wizard ran through the process quickly and I was soon connected with WiFi and the Internet. I had the choice to transfer data from my phone which makes things handy to have the same apps on both items.  The anti reflective screen is good when working in the sun. All the settings you would need are there for adjusting brightness and any other screen issues.  The resolution is also very good. Watching videos is cool. The resolution is vibrant. That also goes for the cameras. Both front and back cameras show clear imagery and clear colours.  The S pen is very useful and fun. It glides smoothly over the screen when writing. Very good at distinguishing writing styles.  When you press the pen button on the side of the screen it gives you several options of things you can do.  my favourite thing so far that I have found on this tablet is Sketch to image. Had so much fun drawing pics (not at all good) and using AI to change the image into an artwork.\nThere are plenty of other good things about this tablet which I have yet to check out.  So far the battery has lasted a lot longer than I had expected."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After using this tablet for a few days, I can say that getting a device like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus probably does make the most amount of sense for the everyday average person but there is a caveat. The Tab S10 Plus is giving you an overall bigger-sized 12.4-inch dynamic AMOLED display, so this thing is a quite huge if I'm being honest. It's also giving you 120 Hz on this type of panel as well, which, again, is a very, very nice type of panel to have. You also get things like stylus S-Pen support, microSD card slots which is really, really nice. The tablet is really good build quality and feels solid while holding.\nRegarding the cameras, on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, you have dual camera setup on the back—a 13mp wide and an 8mp ultra-wide camera. And on the front side, you have a 12mp ultra-wide camera. It basically gives you the capability of having 4K at 30fps on both cameras and that is a pretty decent resolution to have inside of these types of tablets. It's not anything super crazy or super powerful; it's a pretty basic type of lens when it comes down to it. And that's just kind of what happens when you're getting these types of tablets, right? These things aren't necessarily supposed to be competing with the top Android phones or top iPhones of this day and age. I have compared the photos and videos from both the front and back cameras with my S24+ and the quality difference is really noticeable. Even for video calls, the quality of the tablet cameras is an issue from my perspective. \nThere's a really big increase in battery life compared to previous versions. The Tab S10 Plus is giving you a 10,090 mAh battery inside and I could notice that it does last at least 3-4 hours longer than other tablets. I think this might have to do with the chipset as well as Samsung has added a newer chipset inside. I believe it was supposed to be giving you that Snapdragon chipset, but on GSM Arena, it's telling me the MediaTek Dimensity chipset. But either way, on the Tab S10 Plus, you're getting 12 GB of RAM and I could run all the games and apps without any issues. I did notice a bit of lag while playing games like Call of Duty etc but nothing significant.\nOverall, I think this is a decent tablet but the initial price seems too high considering the camera performance and processor issues. If you can get it for a deal on Black Friday for around 30-40% off, it will be worth its price."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Incredible machine!!! perfect size for any task, i like tablets for it s mobility, Samsung tabS10+ perfectly suitable for kids homework's, streaming hd movies , playing demanding games and obviously work, especially with support of AI, this is future, our tablet ia always in use, thanks for the long lasting battery, i will always recommend Samsung tablets as they're best in class and will never disappoint!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10+ within 24 hours of ordering. The Samsung packaging was up to its usual high standard.\n\nMy initial impression upon unboxing was very positive: the tablet has a large, high-quality screen and a solid build. When I powered it on, I was mesmerized by the OLED display—colors are bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is impressive as well.\n\nNavigation is smooth, with fast app opening and easy switching between apps. After using it for a few days, I’m also impressed by the battery life, averaging around 8 hours.\n\nThe included pen is accurate and responsive, making it a pleasure to use though the touch screen is responsive and easy to control and navigate around with.\n\nIf there’s one minor drawback, it’s the camera quality, which is average. However, I don’t plan on taking many photos with a 12.4” tablet, so this isn’t an issue for me.\n\nI have started to use it to do some work in terms of learning python programming so see how that evolves to development of some simple applications.\n\nOverall, I’m very happy with this Samsung tablet. It’s a definite upgrade from my previous device.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When it comes to Android tablets, there is noone else than Samsung who knows how to design and produce one. Samsung tablets are excellent and up to speed on technology and functionality. I've upgraded to the S10+ from the older model and you can see the main and most impressive feature - huge improvement in anti reflection of the 12.4inch screen.\nOf course, as a flagship tablet you get the top of lost characteristics - excellent Amoled colours, powerful surround sound speakers, processor power for mustitasking on the multi screens, and long battery life. Galaxy AI is present too and my favourite Circle to Search works so much better on a bigger screen offering more results at a glance.\nIf you find the Ultra model too high tech, but need a device to browse, consume multimedia, watch movies on the train or plane, or even type a couple of emails with the keyboard case - S10 Plus is for you!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tablet is one of the best I\'ve used in years! I love how easy it was to sync up with my Samsung A40 phone, the apps transferred quickly and easily. The 12.4"" screen is perfect for things like Netflix and other videos. I love how thin it is and lightweight, never had one so thin! I will get a case at some point for it. \n\nI love the brightness and crispness of the screen, I\'ve taken a few pictures with the camera\'s, they are good but I didn\'t want/buy this for the camera and they aren\'t the feature I was excited about. I was excited to try the AI draw to sketch, this is amazing! Will play around a bit more on that but first impressions of the tablet as a whole is amazing. There were a few apps, for reading I wanted to get on a bigger screen and as I can sync my phone to this, I\'ve managed to get them onto the tablet and solved my problem! \n\nVery good product, stunning design, lightweight, love the stylus that is included and has made writing notes so much easier as it changes to text, another thing I\'ve not used before but it\'s amazing!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ really impressed me. When I first picked it up, I expected good performance, but it went above and beyond. Starting with the screen—it’s large, bright, and offers a sharp image, making even simple tasks enjoyable. Games run smoothly, and the device stays cool, which is rare for something so thin. For example, PUBG Mobile can be played at 120 fps, and the tablet handles it perfectly.\n\nWith the built-in Dolby Atmos feature, the sound is simply amazing: the bass is deep, and everything sounds immersive. I was pleasantly surprised by this sound quality on such a compact device. After just one day of use, I bought a protective screen and a drawing film—it made me want to keep it looking new as long as possible.\n\nAnd of course, the battery—it’s a true “monster”! With active use, it holds a charge for a long time, so I need to charge it less often than expected. All this makes the Galaxy Tab S10+ more than just a tablet; it’s a versatile device for work, games, and entertainment that fits perfectly with my needs.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung S10+ is an impressive device. The large display is the first thing you notice as it's super vibrant, sharp, and it really draws you in, whether you’re streaming, drawing, or browsing.

But if you’re after a laptop alternative or something to binge-watch shows on, it feels great!\n\nThe S Pen and the way it magnetically attaches is a great touch and I'm looking forward to experimenting with this further as I get to grips with everything."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfectly packaged, the tablet arrives with a charging lead (no plug) though the lead does fit into any Samsung plug. I was pleased a pen is also included that fits securely in place on the back of the tablet so you cannot lose or misplace it. I have never owned a Samsung tablet, but this is the perfect size to hold with both hands whilst its slim design does not make it bulky, it will fit perfectly in a bag or to take with you on those long travel journeys to keep you or someone else occupied. \n\nI found the process of setting it up really easy, you can either set it up manually or use the same settings your Samsung phone uses, but the set up wizard does all the hard work automatically for you. I loved how quick and effectively it takes to use the  tablet and found its so easy to use, just like your using your phone but with a larger screen.\n\nDepending on what you want to do with the tablet, i have caught up with emails, written articles, watched videos with excellent sound and you can use headphones that plug into the charging socket, the possibilities  are endless!

It has proved a great addition for both work and leisure situations within my daily life and routine. The screen is large and spacious, the speakers are of a quality that really do enhance my multimedia operations, and the operating system is the fastest I have ever owned. The accompanying pen is a very welcome addition to my bundle. It is great for taking notes in meetings, but also for drawing and creating sketches. The battery life is highly impressive, and a single charge lasts a lot longer than my current tablet ever did. The fast charging option is a real innovative feature that is handy in certain situations throughout the week. Overall, an excellent purchase that has exceeded my expectations by far. As time goes by it will improve my work productivity and organsiation, as well as adding a new dimension to my leisure time and multimedia activities.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I opened the box and the ease to set up and I linked up to my Samsung account with my phone and all apps and things synced. I loved the Ai tools and the pen making stick drawings come to life. I was using the pen more as it eaiser to write than type. I love the ease from moving to next item.

Samsung AI you can create pictures that turn into animation which I found fantastic and would also be good to amuse the kids for a few hours. \n\nThe tablet itself is an excellent size but compact enough in a case to travel around with me. Another key positive is the Bluetooth S pen. The pen writes really well and its  fantastic when you don't feel like typing. It is also great for navigating through different apps and around the web.  I can attach the pen to the back of the tablet to charge up and use air actions instead. \n\nThe SD card is safely tucked away so no dust of dirt would get inside. Also its securely locked in. \n\nIt's got an added anti glare screen and has a stunning Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with Vision Booster.

This device truly takes things to the next level with its sleek design, stunning display, and powerful AI features. The AI integration, in particular, adds a layer of intelligence and ease that I didn’t know I needed until now—it’s like having a personal assistant at your fingertips. Whether I'm multitasking or just enjoying content, everything is smoother, faster, and more intuitive.\n\nThe display is a noticeable upgrade, making streaming, gaming, and productivity feel immersive and efficient. Battery life is exceptional, and the performance of this device is flawless. It’s the perfect blend of power and portability, and if you're a Samsung lover like me, this tablet is a must-have."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ has been an excellent addition to my tech collection, especially as someone who already owns and loves the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. The integration between the two devices just works without issue, as it allowed for easy syncing and sharing across platforms. As my first Samsung tablet, I’m rather impressed with its capabilities and the overall experience.\n\nPersonally, the thing that stood out to me the most is the 12.4-inch AMOLED display. It is a real showstopper, with crisp visuals and vibrant colours. It doesn't matter if I'm gaming, streaming, or using productivity apps, the 120Hz refresh rate makes for a buttery-smooth experience, I don't think I could ever go back to a 60Hz display. The MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor (my first experience of a MediaTek processor and I'm impressed) and 12GB of RAM make multitasking a breeze, whether I'm switching between apps or using Samsung’s multi-window feature to run multiple apps at once.\n\nI have put this tablet through its paces, especially in gaming, and it hasn’t faltered once. Running a benchmark test (Geekbench specifically) revealed some impressive scores, giving statistical context to just how good this device is for both gaming and productivity. The battery life easily lasts through a full day of normal use. \n\nBeing familiar with the One UI ecosystem, I already found the tablet intuitive and easy to navigate. Though even for beginners, the interface is quite user-friendly, and should be simple for anyone who has some experience with the Android operating system. For creative tasks, I had a lot of fun experimenting with the drawing assist feature, which turned my rough sketch of a pig into a beautiful watercolor artwork which you can see attached to this review—definitely a cool tool for both novices and people more artistic than myself. \n\nOverall, the Galaxy Tab S10+ is a fantastic balance of power, portability, and functionality, perfect for tech enthusiasts like me, and highly recommended for anyone looking to boost productivity or enjoy top-tier entertainment."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently got the Samsung Galaxy S10+ Tablet, and it’s been a game changer for my studies and entertainment. The first thing that stands out is the display. The screen is stunning and makes watching movies and writing notes very easy and immersive.\nAnother shocking feature was the responsiveness of the S-Pen which was very smooth, making it great for note-taking or editing photos. Another cool feature was that the S Pen can be charged in any direction which is very useful. As an avid gamer I also found there to be no lag when using the device for games. Battery life has also been solid, easily lasting me 2 days of moderate use, from browsing and watching videos to gaming. \nNevertheless, there are a few downsides worth mentioning as well. Firstly, the large size makes it a bit bulky and less comfortable to hold for long periods. This can be annoying for casual use, especially without a standing case. Also, the S Pen doesn't have a built-in slot in the tablet itself. This makes it easy to misplace if you're not careful. Despite these minor drawbacks, the S10+ is an impressive tablet that excels in performance and overall functionality. However, it may not be ideal for everyone depending on your specific needs and budget. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a high performance tablet, this is definitely worth considering."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung is no newcomer to the scene of tablets, and with this latest release, the S10+ proves why these tablets are hot-sellers. From the beautiful OLED screen to the punchy AKG Quad speakers and not to mention the new Dimensionality 9300+ Chipset, this is a powerful machine. The battery size will last you a day easily (from experience from my previous S9 tablet!), it will play any multimedia content without hiccups (as it should!) and if you are into productivity features, this tablet does not hold back, especially with the new Galaxy AI features (which I personally do not use, but hey it's a welcome bonus!). Regarding size, the S10+ sits right in the middle of the lineup at 12.4 inches (perfect size for watching Netflix!), it weights about 570grams which is still light and portable. This can also replace a laptop if you buy the Samsung keyboard cover. The moonstone grey colour is great however I prefer the graphite from previous year. The S-Pen, while certainly useful, does not get much use from me. Lastly, if you are upgrading from the S9 series, there are no major changes. I rate it a solid 9.5/10."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S8 tablet to a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, I noticed a huge improvement. The screen quality on the S10 Plus is stunning, especially when viewing videos and playing games. The tablet is extremely fast at loading multiple apps at the same time and switching without any lag or slow down. It's also handy having a microSD slot, as I sometimes prefer saving documents and files for offline viewing.

Despite the large size of this tablet, I find it easily accessible to use whether it be kn your lap, on a desk, on the sofa, in bed etc. I\'ve enjoyed its ergonomics and the feel of using it in every setting I\'ve tried it in. \n\nThe 12.4"" Screen obviously takes centre stage and it is just delightful. The 120hz adaptive refresh rate means scrolling webpages, notes and documents silky smooth. \n\nThe screens brightness and colours pop and stand out and honestly I can\'t help but just using it just so I can use and view the screen. There are a variety of display settings aswell so the Vivid level of colours can be adjusted to suit your taste and preference. \n\nSamsungs ONE U.I interface is super clean, intuitive and works brilliantly in this large display.

Starting with the packaging which was so slim down to the unboxing experience, this tablet has been impressive.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra so the Samsung UI and experience is familiar to me. That did make me feel at home. Copying over apps and data was fairly straightforward with the smart switch from Samsung.  After that was all complete,  I tried the speakers with a YouTube video and they are fairly loud and clear for a tablet. The screen quality is also impressive,  watching a 4K YouTube video was very clear. I am yet to try the 120hz display but I can already notice the butter smooth screen which is partially due to the 120Hz display. The camera quality is quite good. As I have only got this tablet today. I'm yet to try nighttime photography. I'm a fairly power user so I'll be trying the battery life as well. As of now, the battery life is good but not exceptional. I've had a 15 mins Google Meet call and about 30 minutes of browsing through the tab and the battery dropped from 80% to 71%. I was hoping that the drop would be half that. Hopefully, the tab will learn my usage and optimise battery based of that. I plugged it into a fast charger and the battery charges really quick. Early days with this tab but overall I'm very impressed. I have a case and a screen protector being delivered tomorrow so from next week I'll start to use the productivity features at my work.

Until now I have been using my phone's S-pen for note taking which has been okay but not the best."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My previous tablet was the Tab S6 so the Tab s10+ is quite the jump both in perfomance and features. The display is much brighter than previous S Tabs which make using the device outside much better but still not as bright as Samsungs recent phone screens. The 45w fast charging is a welcome addiation compared to the 15w chartging of my older Tab S6. The biggest change I noticed was the 120Hz screen which makes the tablet feel much snappier and fuild compared to older 60Hz screens and along with its large screen size makes the tablet capable of acting as a laptop with the new AI keyboard cover. Editing photos is a breeze on the Tab S10+ with the included AI features and included S-Pen. Very hapopy with the tablet overall and a very good upgrade for anyone on a older Tab S tablet.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Finding an alternative to the current best-in-class tablet has been difficult. But Samsung has dug deep and built a premium tablet that is now the best of its kind. This statement is valid due to the build quality, which feels extremely premium owing to its metal and glass construction yet is remarkably thin! It is paired with a stunning Samsung 12-inch display featuring its beautiful, colour-popping AMOLED technology. The SoC and RAM are top-notch, meaning this tablet is speedy with all tasks. The Mediatek Dimensity 9300+ is a solid choice with the new GPU. It now also excels in gaming and media tasks without issue, and paired with 12 GB of RAM, it never experiences a slowdown. Another feature that puts it ahead of the field is a super-quick and accurate under-display fingerprint reader. This reader keeps your data secure and is paired with a sufficiently good facial unlock for speed, providing you with peace of mind and convenience. For creative tasks, unlike other tablets, it comes with a stylus in the box at no extra charge, allowing you to draw and navigate with ease, which is nice to have and again offers flexibility ahead of the market. The speakers are tuned by AKG and can initially seem quiet, but you can unlock the extra volume and sound options. I downloaded the Samsung Good Lock Sound Manager, which provided me with the extra volume I needed to use the device as a media consumption device. I dare say the One UI Android is now my favourite and preferred version of Android—purest, don’t shoot me! I have tried all the Android skins, and Samsung has finally achieved the perfect level of polish and extensibility. This is accomplished with an excellent overall skin and all the power tweaks that can be unlocked using their “Good Lock” ecosystem.

I have put it through its paces, playing Sim,  racing and first person shooter games. The S10+ did not falter once, with the processor and vivid screen keeping up with the demands with ease. Similarly, I have experimented several times with multitasking on the Tab, watching YouTube videos while browsing the Web, checking emails and even doodling using the PENUP app (which feels eerily natural). \n\nWhile it's more expensive sibling, the S10 Ultra, may take the plaudits due to its larger size,  the S10+ is more than capable to meet the needs of even the most demanding power user. This, however, as alluded to previously, comes at a cost.

This has been invaluable for studying multiple subjects and conducting research simultaneously.\nFor students like me who rely heavily on lectures, the Tab S10+ is a lifesaver.

I don't have to worry about using the Tab S10+ outdoors, regardless of the weather.\nWhile the Tab S10+ is an excellent device, there are a few minor drawbacks. The limited color options can be a constraint for those who prefer more variety. Additionally, the placement of the S Pen, which magnetically attaches to the back of the tablet for charging, can be inconvenient if you don't have a case to secure it.\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ is a fantastic investment for students.

The fast charging option is a real innovative feature that is handy in certain situations throughout the week.\n\nOverall, an excellent purchase that has exceeded my expectations by far. As time goes by it will improve my work productivity and organsiation, as well as adding a new dimension to my leisure time and multimedia activities.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using my  Galaxy Tab S10+ since the 11th of October 2024 and l have been blown away.

Its stylus integration, large screen, and multitasking capabilities make it efficient for creative work, while the AMOLED display and high-quality speakers enhance the multimedia experience. The tablet also performs well with tasks like sound editing, gaming, and digital drawing, making it suitable for a range of users. Galaxy AI further enhances the experience by automating tasks and adapting to the user\'s needs, although some AI features, like ""sketch from image,"" need improvement. Overall, the device offers a refreshing and intuitive approach to daily tasks, reinvigorating the user\'s interest in technology.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As someone who juggles work, hobbies, and a bit of entertainment, this tablet has seamlessly integrated into my life.\n\nFirst off, the 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is stunning. Whether I’m watching movies, sketching, or just browsing the web, the colors are vibrant, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel incredibly smooth. It’s like having a mini cinema in my hands!\n\nThe S Pen that comes with it has been a pleasant surprise. I wasn’t sure how much I’d use it, but it’s become an essential tool for note-taking and doodling during meetings. The responsiveness is top-notch, and it feels just like writing on paper.Multitasking is a breeze, and I’ve yet to experience any lag, even with multiple apps open. The battery life is impressive too, lasting me through a full day of heavy use.\n\nOne of the standout features for me is the AI enhancements. Features like Circle to Search and Sketch to Image have made my workflow more efficient and fun which I have become accostomed to since their integration into the Galaxy s24 ultra handset I also possess . It’s clear that Samsung has put a lot of thought into making this tablet not just powerful, but also smart and intuitive. \n\nHowever, it’s not all perfect. The keyboard isn’t included, which means an additional purchase if you want to use it for serious productivity tasks  and that is quite te a hefty price to consider if you want it to be even more of a tablet', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is a very impressive tablet. Out of the box it comes with a a S-Pen and type-c to type-c cable but no charger.\n\n\n\n\n\nI found this tablet has one of the best screen displays I have ever used, with the Super AMOLED display it is so vibrant and clear when viewing videos and photos.\n\n\nThe gaming performance is also impressive, it handled all the games I played with ease including Cod mobile which is quite a demanding game.\n\n\n The battery life has been very impressive too when using it moderately through the day giving me about 10 hours roughly so more than enough for day to day use! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe s-pen was probably the best part for me on how responsive it is when you use it to draw or colour in a drawing or just note things down it is fluid and responsive which is very important when using a stylus on any tablet. If you have any kids who love to draw or colour pictures in this tablet will entertain them for hours! \nThe 12gb of Ram really helps when multitasking. I had several apps open a lot of the time and found I could go back into each one without the app having been closed down due to too many being open which was a pleasant surprise. \nThe cameras were decent for a tablet and the quality on video calls were also solid but if you want to use it for actual photography I'd stick to a smartphone. \nOverall even though this tablet is on the premium side of tablets I think. It justifies the cost and if you have other Samsung products like a smartphone for example it seamlessly enters the ecosystem. One thing to note is that I did find at times it was quite heavy when using it for long sessions. So if you prefer something lighter this tablet may not be the one for you."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had the chance to unwrap the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus over the weekend, and impressive would be an understatement. From running heavy apps to casual browsing, this tablet handled everything effortlessly.\n\nThe hardware is impressive, with a top class display enhanced by an anti-reflective coating. While I wish the bezels were slightly slimmer, the overall design is sleek and modern. The sound quality from its four tiny speakers is surprisingly solid for such a thin device—I even ditched my headphones to watch a series, and the audio was spot on.\n\nBuild-wise, it feels solid and durable, with no flex, which is exactly what you'd expect from a premium tablet. The battery life is excellent, lasting me about a full day of heavy use before needing a recharge.\n\nOn the software side, One UI is decent, but if you’re into customisation, the Good Lock app is a must. I’m not a fan of having both Samsung and Google apps that do the same thing, but it’s easy enough to remove the extras, so it’s not a deal breaker. Plus, the included S Pen is a great bonus—you don’t have to purchase it separately, and it really enhances the overall experience.\n\nYes, the price is on the higher end, but it’s been worth every penny. This is easily the best tablet I’ve invested in.\n\nWould I recommend it? Absolutely, 100%."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having used Samsung tablets for many years I couldn't wait to get my hands on the new S10+. First impressions are that it's ultra premium, very lightweight and the screen is beautiful. The device is powered by an octa-core processor and has 12gb RAM so it's lightening fast. Battery life is also awesome as has 10090mah battery. The included S pen works as expected. Overall a very premium tablet but comes at a premium price. Highly recommended""]"

The 12.4"" Screen obviously takes centre stage and it is just delightful. The 120hz adaptive refresh rate means scrolling webpages, notes and documents silky smooth. The screens brightness and colours pop and stand out and honestly I can\'t help but just using it just so I can use and view the screen.

To top it off, circle to search on the big S10 Ultra with the S pen works like it was made for this device only! I am so happy with this device that I am not sure I need a laptop anymore. Any workflow application that I need to run works perfectly. But also enhanced experience with Samsung DEX.

Immediately the first major difference between the s9 and s10 is the new anti reflective coating on the newer s10 screen. Whilst for most this would be barely noticeable having both side by side the s10 really does an amazing job at rejecting glare and reflections. Powering up the tablet the software is familiar which is no bad thing there have been some minor tweaks to the layout however the major additions are the ai focused features.

The tablet is unreal. It's so thin there is barely room for the usb port to charge it, and the screen rivals my high end Samsung AMOLED TV. It's simply superb. The speed of the device is incredible, and the integration with other Samsung devices make the whole experience seamless. My phone and TV, now easily linked with my tablet and notebook. The pen is included and it's so useful, for simple note taking all the way through to art and drawing. I find it really useful as a mindfulness tool when a bit stressed out, Colouring etc. the battery is superb, I used it lots in a few days and had well over 69% battery left which is fantastic. As for gaming!! Amazing. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this item."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 is a captivating fusion of technology and art, perfect for anyone who appreciates the finer things in both realms. The standout feature of this tablet is its display, a veritable masterpiece. Its Super AMOLED screen boasts stunning colours and deep blacks, creating a canvas that feels alive. For art lovers, this means vibrant, accurate colour reproduction, whether you’re viewing high-resolution art or working on a digital sketch. The details are crisp, and the brightness levels make every brushstroke or image feel immersive, even in bright lighting conditions.\n\nThe resolution is a triumph, allowing for an incredibly detailed viewing experience. Watching a movie or examining high-quality photographs is akin to seeing them in a gallery - sharp and precise. The display is also quite large, offering plenty of space for creative expression, especially if you pair it with the S Pen, which feels smooth and responsive on this display. \n\nWhen it comes to performance, the Galaxy Tab S10 excels in a way that complements the display's brilliance. Powered by a robust processor, it handles multitasking with ease, allowing for seamless transitions between apps. Whether you’re editing large image files, rendering 3D models, or streaming high-resolution video, the tablet’s performance is smooth and efficient. There’s a fluidity to how the tablet moves between artistic pursuits, whether you’re editing photos, sketching, or enjoying media.\n\nIn essence, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 is not just a device but a creative tool. Its display quality is visually stunning, while its performance offers the speed and power to back it up. For those who value aesthetics as much as they do functionality, this tablet feels like a work of art itself."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra Tablet is an absolute joy, and not just because it's a techie’s dream come true - it’s a powerhouse of innovation and functionality. Let’s start with the S Pen - it feels almost too real, like you're back to good ol' pen and paper. Taking notes, sketching doodles, or making lists feels completely natural, and when you’re done, the magnetic attachment keeps it snugly in place, eliminating the usual worry of misplacing it.\n\nThe build quality is exceptional - sleek, slim, and surprisingly comfortable to hold, even though it’s quite large. Speaking of size, it can be a bit unwieldy. Holding it in one hand for extended periods might start to feel like a mini workout, but that’s part of the trade-off for such a massive, stunning display. The screen is nothing short of breathtaking - bright, sharp, and detailed, making it perfect for streaming, creative work, or simply scrolling through social media. Watching movies or diving into creative projects feels immersive, almost like having a personal cinema or art studio right in your hands.\n\nPerformance-wise, it’s fast. There’s no lag, no glitches - just buttery smooth operation, even when multitasking with multiple apps open. The front and back cameras are surprisingly good for a tablet, though realistically, most people won’t be using it as their primary camera. It’s great for video calls or a quick snap, but shooting with a screen of this size can feel a bit awkward.\n\nThere are a few downsides, however. The size makes it tricky to use comfortably on the go without a stand or case to prop it up. Additionally, it’s not the most budget-friendly option - it feels premium in every way, but you’re certainly paying for that level of quality. The S Pen, while fantastic, can sometimes feel a little fragile when magnetically attached, so you need to be careful not to knock it loose when handling the tablet.\n\nBattery life is decent, but not groundbreaking. While moderate users will likely get through a day with ease, heavy multitaskers or binge-watchers might find themselves reaching for the charger sooner than they’d prefer.\n\nLastly, Samsung earns points for the minimalist packaging - just what you need to get started, with no unnecessary extras.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra is a creative powerhouse with a stunning display, excellent performance, and a natural, intuitive S Pen experience. It’s big and bold, with a few trade-offs in portability and cost."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] With much anticipation, today finally arrived where i could get my hands on the S10 Ultra Tab. And, i wasnt disappointed. Well packaged first and foremost in stylish boxing, and the finished product is out of this world. Sleek, smooth and ultra responsive, it will compliment my personal and professional life and with AI make everyday tasks easier. Colour is magnificent and not weight heavy either, My only drawback is that the GB should be 512 as a starter, not 256. I recommend this product,', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab Ultra is so sleek for such a large tablet, I genuinely couldn't believe how thin it was! \n\nIt was incredibly easy to set up and link to my Samsung account, so I was able to get stuck in immediately. The first thing I really love is the ability to multitask! You can open multiple apps and have enough space for each, which saves you from having to adjust by zooming or scrolling.\xa0 It was a huge timesaver for me, and I ended up using one side for the main app and the other for two windows that I could refer to. \n\nThe AI feature has also been a lot of fun, especially for note-taking. You can select text to summarise quickly, run a spell check (which also helped with grammar) or make doodles more appealing! Editing images has also been interesting, and it's surprisingly quick and easy to create with. \n\nThe ability to draw on this tablet was really important to me, and it's such an enjoyable experience. The tip of the S Pen makes drawing a pleasure, as it feels more natural compared with a plastic nib. The pressure sensitivity worked really well for me, as well as the palm rejection. The suggested apps were a perfect way to help me dive into digital art and note-taking, so that was a bonus! \n\nI also had a great gaming session. The tablet is the perfect size to pop onto the coffee table and kick back. Everything looked amazing, and it didn't struggle at all to keep up with streaming games or when I decided to watch a film. The sound quality is perfect too; I didn't need it on its loudest setting, but the sound was still smooth, offering a comfortable listening experience for me. \n\nOverall, I'm beyond impressed with this tablet and would definitely recommend it to creatives and multitaskers alike. It has the power to handle anything I throw at it and looks amazing doing it."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have become a big fan of this tablet already. Obvious thing first up, the size is a joy to use. And for something so big I'm amazed at how light and thin this thing is, but at the same time still feels like a quality build.\n\nAny kind of media on this thing is amazing, the new screen really cuts down on reflections so even outside it's so easy to see what you're doing. Videos look great and even for gaming it's like having your own mini TV so feels a big step up from other smaller tablets. \n\nReally fast to use, the AI functions work great too and it fits in seamlessly with my Samsung phone and my buds connect very easily to it too. The pen too, which is nice to see included in the box rather than an additional purchase, works so smoothly for art or note taking. \n\nOverall simply amazed by this tablet and it's going to become one of my main daily use devices, whether that's to get some work done, simple browsing or watching some media."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchasing the Samsung Tab S10 Ultra initially seemed abstract, but it quickly impressed me with its functionality. The stylus, especially when paired with TalkBack, made the device highly convenient. While I mainly use it for entertainment and content consumption, it’s also great for creation, including graphic and text projects. The lack of a Samsung Keyboard slightly affects typing efficiency, but overall productivity is still impressive.\nYes, the Samsung Tab S10 Ultra is really a large device! Its huge screen, over 14 inches, makes it ideal for work, multimedia, and also for drawing or editing projects. It provides a lot of workspace, but it definitely takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to smaller devices.\n\nThe tablet’s multitasking capabilities, thanks to its large screen, allow for multiple apps like Chrome, ChatGPT, and Word to be open simultaneously, enhancing efficiency. Tasks like document creation, sketching, and browsing are smooth, making it an excellent tool for creative individuals.\n\nIn terms of multimedia, the speakers offer great sound quality, and the AMOLED display delivers rich, detailed colors, making it perfect for movies or music. The tablet also performs well in sound editing with apps like WaveEditor, providing professional audio tools. Gaming is enjoyable, with easy connection to an Xbox controller, especially for more complex mobile games via cloud platforms.\n\nThe battery life is impressive, lasting several days under normal usage. For digital sketching, apps like Krita and PenUp work seamlessly, with Krita offering advanced tools for experienced users, while PenUp is perfect for beginners."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a consumer, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has truly impressed me with its blend of performance, display quality, and features. \nThe first thing that caught my eye was the massive 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It’s not just big; it’s stunning with its 16:10 aspect ratio, perfect for binge-watching shows and multitasking. Despite its size, the tablet is surprisingly thin and light, with a sleek, modern design that feels premium in hand.\nThe display is absolutely gorgeous. With a resolution of 2960 x 1848 and a 120Hz refresh rate, everything looks vibrant and smooth. The new anti-reflective coating is a game-changer, making it easy to use even in bright sunlight. This tablet is a beast. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ chipset, it handles everything I throw at it, from gaming to video editing, without breaking a sweat. With options for 12GB or 16GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. Samsung has packed this tablet with useful features. The Galaxy AI tools and S Pen integration make it incredibly versatile. The S Pen, which comes included, is perfect for taking notes and drawing. The tablet runs on the latest Android version with Samsung’s One UI, which is user-friendly and highly customizable. The audio quality is fantastic, thanks to the quad-speaker setup. The camera system is solid too, with a 13MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the back, plus dual 12MP front-facing cameras for great video calls and selfies.\nThe 11,200mAh battery easily lasts a full day, even with heavy use. Fast charging support is a lifesaver, getting me back up and running quickly.\nYes, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is worth every penny if you’re looking for top-notch performance, display quality, and features. Whether you’re a professional needing a powerful tool or a media enthusiast wanting an immersive experience, this tablet delivers.\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has set a new standard for Android tablets, combining cutting-edge technology with a sleek design to offer an exceptional user experience.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had a week with the S10 Ultra and am loving every second of it.\nMigrating from my old tablet was a breeze using Smart Switch, and it even organized my home screen the way I had it before. \n\nThe in-display fingerprint reader strikes a good balance between security and ease of unlocking the tablet. It's one of the tings you won't find in many other (and cheaper) tablets on the market. \nThe storage is decent at 256GB, with the option to expand via MicroSD if I ever need to.\nThe AI features are a new addition this year and are good fun - particularly the drawing to image and portrait to cartoon modes which I'm still playing around with. \n\nThe screen is absolutely gorgeous, and is probably one of the stand-out features of the S10 line. It's perfect for watching TV and movies in high definition, or even viewing your own photos and videos from your phone (which can be easily synced between devices).\nWith a screen this size, I was worried that the battery would suffer, but this thing lasts me 3-4 days on a single charge. The only downside is the sheer size of the device, but the plus model is just as good in a smaller package if that's more your style.\n\nI've barely scratched the surface of what this device is capable, but if you're looking for the best of the best tablets available today then look no further than the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is nothing short of a beast of a tablet. With a screen of 14.6” and at only 5.4mm thin, it’s by far the largest and the thinnest tablet I’ve ever used, and one of the thinnest on the market, and as such is striking when you first take it out of the box and hold it for the first time. At first I thought it was perhaps TOO big, however i quickly got used to the size and now my current 11” tablet just feels small in comparison!\n\nThe Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen looks incredible no matter what you are doing on the tablet. Videos really pop and the size of the screen makes the experience of watching a movie so immersive. I’ve used it for streaming games via Xbox Cloud Gaming and it’s like having a mini-TV to play it on! Wifi 7 included means you’ll get the very best wifi speeds for zero lag gaming as well.\n\nThe screen real estate offered here means that the tablet is amazing for note taking and working on Office documents. You can see a good amount of cells within an Excel sheet, and editing and annotating PowerPoint presentations is easy with the included S-Pen which attaches to the back of the tablet. Using a keyboard case (or a Bluetooth keyboard) and you could easily use this tablet to do serious email and document editing, possibly replacing a laptop!\n\nThere was controversy with Samsung moving away from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors to using the Dimensity 9300+, with many seeing it as a step down in quality of processor, however I’ve not seen any noticeable lag when using the tablet so far, and it handled emulating GameCube games without a hitch, so thumbs up from me.\n\nCameras are good enough for this tablet, but won’t come close to the quality of the latest phones, but why you’d be using a tablet like this to take a lot of photos is beyond me.\n\nAll in all, this is a monster tablet for monster usage - whether that be as a multimedia powerhouse or a fantastic office productivity machine, it’ll easily do it all!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tablet seamlessly blends style and functionality, offering a truly premium experience.

One of the standout features is AMOLED display, the colours are vibrant as feels like an immersive experience. The tablet’s processing is so smooth and simple whether I’m browsing, editing documents or streaming videos.\n\nI am very impressed with standby time and battery life. Whilst on standby, it barely uses any battery life. With heavy use of watching YouTube videos, streaming games I still managing around 10hours of use out of a full charge which is impressive for a device this size.\n\nAs for the size of this tablet, I like it. I think the larger size would have been too big, this one is just the right size for me. I can carry it around with me throughout the day without it feeling like I'm lugging a TV screen around with me. It's quite light without feeling too light, like it could break very easily. It feels durable in the hand and I feel comfortable taking it with me wherever I go.\n\nThe screen is the perfect size to create or amend documents, also for watching videos on due to its clear large screen. This makes it the ideal on the go tablet for both work and pleasure. I haven't used it to its full extent yet and still finding new features, but overall first impressions are that it is a great piece of kit and will undoubtedly be taking more use than my current laptop does!\n\nThis tab certainly isn't a cheap product but you really get your money's worth from what I can tell.

The tablet size is great for watching YouTube videos, Netflix, etc. It's also great for being able to browse websites such as BBC, Google, etc., without having a strain on the eyes.\n\nMy previous tablet was also a Samsung, but a good few generations previous. This new tablet is much better than the previous one. It is much faster, has a better processor and general speeds of processing are much better.\n\nThe screen size was daunting at first, as it generally needs two hands to operate the tablet safely, however, with a third party tablet case, this has given the tablet an additional sense of security. Please note: the uploaded picture does not have this case on it.\n\nOverall, this tablet lives up to my expectations of a new tablet. It's quicker, I like the big screen size, it has a very good clear screen, and doesn't show me my reflection when watching videos or movies. Good value for money with what the tablet offers. \n\nI would definitely recommend this tablet, especially due to the large screen size, the clarity of picture detail it offers, the speed and quickness of the tablet, and also the fact that the S Pen is magnetic and always stays connected to the back of the tablet - so you can't, or at least shouldn't, lose it."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have always loved large tablets and this is one of the largest of its kind anywhere.

I noticed no slowdown in any of the games I played. Some would stutter on other tablets after a prolonged session. This is a testament to the efficiency/cooling of this S10 design.\n\nWhen it comes to work, I always have my trusty tablet with me, along with a keyboard case and Microsoft 365. It makes editing documents and emails on the go a breeze.

This is a huge selling point -trust me give them the pen and see what creative drawings appear. \n\nYou use the S Pen to sketch anything you like and then use AI to bring it to life.

Powered by a robust processor, it handles multitasking with ease, allowing for seamless transitions between apps. Whether you’re editing large image files, rendering 3D models, or streaming high-resolution video, the tablet’s performance is smooth and efficient. There’s a fluidity to how the tablet moves between artistic pursuits, whether you’re editing photos, sketching, or enjoying media.\n\nIn essence, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 is not just a device but a creative tool. Its display quality is visually stunning, while its performance offers the speed and power to back it up. For those who value aesthetics as much as they do functionality, this tablet feels like a work of art itself."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra Tablet is an absolute joy, and not just because it's a techie’s dream come true - it’s a powerhouse of innovation and functionality. Let’s start with the S Pen - it feels almost too real, like you're back to good ol' pen and paper. Taking notes, sketching doodles, or making lists feels completely natural, and when you’re done, the magnetic attachment keeps it snugly in place, eliminating the usual worry of misplacing it.\n\nThe build quality is exceptional - sleek, slim, and surprisingly comfortable to hold, even though it’s quite large. Speaking of size, it can be a bit unwieldy. Holding it in one hand for extended periods might start to feel like a mini workout, but that’s part of the trade-off for such a massive, stunning display. The screen is nothing short of breathtaking - bright, sharp, and detailed, making it perfect for streaming, creative work, or simply scrolling through social media. Watching movies or diving into creative projects feels immersive, almost like having a personal cinema or art studio right in your hands.\n\nPerformance-wise, it’s fast. There’s no lag, no glitches - just buttery smooth operation, even when multitasking with multiple apps open. The front and back cameras are surprisingly good for a tablet, though realistically, most people won’t be using it as their primary camera. It’s great for video calls or a quick snap, but shooting with a screen of this size can feel a bit awkward.\n\nThere are a few downsides, however. The size makes it tricky to use comfortably on the go without a stand or case to prop it up. Additionally, it’s not the most budget-friendly option - it feels premium in every way, but you’re certainly paying for that level of quality. The S Pen, while fantastic, can sometimes feel a little fragile when magnetically attached, so you need to be careful not to knock it loose when handling the tablet.\n\nBattery life is decent, but not groundbreaking. While moderate users will likely get through a day with ease, heavy multitaskers or binge-watchers might find themselves reaching for the charger sooner than they’d prefer.\n\nLastly, Samsung earns points for the minimalist packaging - just what you need to get started, with no unnecessary extras.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra is a creative powerhouse with a stunning display, excellent performance, and a natural, intuitive S Pen experience. It’s big and bold, with a few trade-offs in portability and cost."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] With much anticipation, today finally arrived where i could get my hands on the S10 Ultra Tab. And, i wasnt disappointed. Well packaged first and foremost in stylish boxing, and the finished product is out of this world. Sleek, smooth and ultra responsive, it will compliment my personal and professional life and with AI make everyday tasks easier. Colour is magnificent and not weight heavy either, My only drawback is that the GB should be 512 as a starter, not 256. I recommend this product,', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab Ultra is so sleek for such a large tablet, I genuinely couldn't believe how thin it was! \n\nIt was incredibly easy to set up and link to my Samsung account, so I was able to get stuck in immediately. The first thing I really love is the ability to multitask! You can open multiple apps and have enough space for each, which saves you from having to adjust by zooming or scrolling.\xa0 It was a huge timesaver for me, and I ended up using one side for the main app and the other for two windows that I could refer to. \n\nThe AI feature has also been a lot of fun, especially for note-taking. You can select text to summarise quickly, run a spell check (which also helped with grammar) or make doodles more appealing! Editing images has also been interesting, and it's surprisingly quick and easy to create with. \n\nThe ability to draw on this tablet was really important to me, and it's such an enjoyable experience. The tip of the S Pen makes drawing a pleasure, as it feels more natural compared with a plastic nib. The pressure sensitivity worked really well for me, as well as the palm rejection. The suggested apps were a perfect way to help me dive into digital art and note-taking, so that was a bonus! \n\nI also had a great gaming session. The tablet is the perfect size to pop onto the coffee table and kick back. Everything looked amazing, and it didn't struggle at all to keep up with streaming games or when I decided to watch a film. The sound quality is perfect too; I didn't need it on its loudest setting, but the sound was still smooth, offering a comfortable listening experience for me. \n\nOverall, I'm beyond impressed with this tablet and would definitely recommend it to creatives and multitaskers alike.

Videos look great and even for gaming it's like having your own mini TV so feels a big step up from other smaller tablets. \n\nReally fast to use, the AI functions work great too and it fits in seamlessly with my Samsung phone and my buds connect very easily to it too. The pen too, which is nice to see included in the box rather than an additional purchase, works so smoothly for art or note taking. \n\nOverall simply amazed by this tablet and it's going to become one of my main daily use devices, whether that's to get some work done, simple browsing or watching some media."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchasing the Samsung Tab S10 Ultra initially seemed abstract, but it quickly impressed me with its functionality. The stylus, especially when paired with TalkBack, made the device highly convenient. While I mainly use it for entertainment and content consumption, it’s also great for creation, including graphic and text projects. The lack of a Samsung Keyboard slightly affects typing efficiency, but overall productivity is still impressive.\nYes, the Samsung Tab S10 Ultra is really a large device! Its huge screen, over 14 inches, makes it ideal for work, multimedia, and also for drawing or editing projects. It provides a lot of workspace, but it definitely takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to smaller devices.\n\nThe tablet’s multitasking capabilities, thanks to its large screen, allow for multiple apps like Chrome, ChatGPT, and Word to be open simultaneously, enhancing efficiency. Tasks like document creation, sketching, and browsing are smooth, making it an excellent tool for creative individuals.\n\nIn terms of multimedia, the speakers offer great sound quality, and the AMOLED display delivers rich, detailed colors, making it perfect for movies or music. The tablet also performs well in sound editing with apps like WaveEditor, providing professional audio tools. Gaming is enjoyable, with easy connection to an Xbox controller, especially for more complex mobile games via cloud platforms.\n\nThe battery life is impressive, lasting several days under normal usage. For digital sketching, apps like Krita and PenUp work seamlessly, with Krita offering advanced tools for experienced users, while PenUp is perfect for beginners."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a consumer, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has truly impressed me with its blend of performance, display quality, and features. \nThe first thing that caught my eye was the massive 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It’s not just big; it’s stunning with its 16:10 aspect ratio, perfect for binge-watching shows and multitasking. Despite its size, the tablet is surprisingly thin and light, with a sleek, modern design that feels premium in hand.\nThe display is absolutely gorgeous. With a resolution of 2960 x 1848 and a 120Hz refresh rate, everything looks vibrant and smooth. The new anti-reflective coating is a game-changer, making it easy to use even in bright sunlight.

The audio quality is fantastic, thanks to the quad-speaker setup. The camera system is solid too, with a 13MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the back, plus dual 12MP front-facing cameras for great video calls and selfies.\nThe 11,200mAh battery easily lasts a full day, even with heavy use. Fast charging support is a lifesaver, getting me back up and running quickly.\nYes, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is worth every penny if you’re looking for top-notch performance, display quality, and features.

It's one of the tings you won't find in many other (and cheaper) tablets on the market. \nThe storage is decent at 256GB, with the option to expand via MicroSD if I ever need to.\nThe AI features are a new addition this year and are good fun - particularly the drawing to image and portrait to cartoon modes which I'm still playing around with. \n\nThe screen is absolutely gorgeous, and is probably one of the stand-out features of the S10 line. It's perfect for watching TV and movies in high definition, or even viewing your own photos and videos from your phone (which can be easily synced between devices).\nWith a screen this size, I was worried that the battery would suffer, but this thing lasts me 3-4 days on a single charge. The only downside is the sheer size of the device, but the plus model is just as good in a smaller package if that's more your style.\n\nI've barely scratched the surface of what this device is capable, but if you're looking for the best of the best tablets available today then look no further than the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is nothing short of a beast of a tablet. With a screen of 14.6” and at only 5.4mm thin, it’s by far the largest and the thinnest tablet I’ve ever used, and one of the thinnest on the market, and as such is striking when you first take it out of the box and hold it for the first time. At first I thought it was perhaps TOO big, however i quickly got used to the size and now my current 11” tablet just feels small in comparison!\n\nThe Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen looks incredible no matter what you are doing on the tablet. Videos really pop and the size of the screen makes the experience of watching a movie so immersive. I’ve used it for streaming games via Xbox Cloud Gaming and it’s like having a mini-TV to play it on! Wifi 7 included means you’ll get the very best wifi speeds for zero lag gaming as well.\n\nThe screen real estate offered here means that the tablet is amazing for note taking and working on Office documents. You can see a good amount of cells within an Excel sheet, and editing and annotating PowerPoint presentations is easy with the included S-Pen which attaches to the back of the tablet. Using a keyboard case (or a Bluetooth keyboard) and you could easily use this tablet to do serious email and document editing, possibly replacing a laptop!\n\nThere was controversy with Samsung moving away from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors to using the Dimensity 9300+, with many seeing it as a step down in quality of processor, however I’ve not seen any noticeable lag when using the tablet so far, and it handled emulating GameCube games without a hitch, so thumbs up from me.\n\nCameras are good enough for this tablet, but won’t come close to the quality of the latest phones, but why you’d be using a tablet like this to take a lot of photos is beyond me.\n\nAll in all, this is a monster tablet for monster usage - whether that be as a multimedia powerhouse or a fantastic office productivity machine, it’ll easily do it all!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tablet seamlessly blends style and functionality, offering a truly premium experience.

The screen ratio is also great for side by side application use which helps productivity. Expandable storage is a huge win, helping future proof the device for years to come. \n\nIt’s super slim yet still feels strong, though I’m not one to test out just how strong so I’ve added a cover which still results in being able to easily slide it into a backpack or laptop bag. Being waterproof is a nice stress reliever when the kids are drawing on the tablet with their drinks nearby. The S-Pen is super useful for productivity tasks / note taking and creativity. Nice that it is bundled with the tablet and not a separate purchase. Also the camera’s are very good, especially for a tablet.

The Notes application is powerful, converting handwriting and recorded notes to text which can then be further processed / summarised by the AI tools. Also generating images from sketches.

Whether reviewing documents or watching videos, the large, bright screen enhances every experience. It’s also easy to split the screen between apps, which is particularly useful for productivity. The display quality really shines for streaming shows or working on design apps.\n\nBattery Life\n\nBattery life is another strong point.

But after investing in the S10+ I can see this being a great addition to my household. \n\nFor the past 2 weeks it has lived on the coffee table in the living room. We as a family have used it for a variety of tasks in an effortless manner: Controlling the lights in the living room,  being notified when our Samsung Dishwasher had finished, scrolling the web, checking emails and its even been used to watch the football whilst my wife watches her favourite series on the TV! \n\nI love how light it feels in your hands and how responsive the screen is.

I bought the slim AI keyboard for this and I'm not disappointed! It's compact, attaches magnetically and takes the table to the next level. It's a real productivity machine, great for video calls, mega battery life and all the things you'd expect from a Samsung tablet like excellent performance and a top notch screen. I loved the anti glare screen on the S24 Ultra and it's just as good on the S10 range. Completely recommended for similar use cases!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Tab S10+ arrived in a solid box with a charging lead (no plug) and a S pen. With a 12.4' screen it is a very good size for having on your lap and for carry around.  Once fully charged it was easy enough to set up. The wizard ran through the process quickly and I was soon connected with WiFi and the Internet. I had the choice to transfer data from my phone which makes things handy to have the same apps on both items.  The anti reflective screen is good when working in the sun. All the settings you would need are there for adjusting brightness and any other screen issues.  The resolution is also very good. Watching videos is cool. The resolution is vibrant. That also goes for the cameras. Both front and back cameras show clear imagery and clear colours.  The S pen is very useful and fun. It glides smoothly over the screen when writing. Very good at distinguishing writing styles.  When you press the pen button on the side of the screen it gives you several options of things you can do.  my favourite thing so far that I have found on this tablet is Sketch to image. Had so much fun drawing pics (not at all good) and using AI to change the image into an artwork.\nThere are plenty of other good things about this tablet which I have yet to check out.  So far the battery has lasted a lot longer than I had expected."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After using this tablet for a few days, I can say that getting a device like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus probably does make the most amount of sense for the everyday average person but there is a caveat. The Tab S10 Plus is giving you an overall bigger-sized 12.4-inch dynamic AMOLED display, so this thing is a quite huge if I'm being honest. It's also giving you 120 Hz on this type of panel as well, which, again, is a very, very nice type of panel to have. You also get things like stylus S-Pen support, microSD card slots which is really, really nice. The tablet is really good build quality and feels solid while holding.\nRegarding the cameras, on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, you have dual camera setup on the back—a 13mp wide and an 8mp ultra-wide camera. And on the front side, you have a 12mp ultra-wide camera. It basically gives you the capability of having 4K at 30fps on both cameras and that is a pretty decent resolution to have inside of these types of tablets. It's not anything super crazy or super powerful; it's a pretty basic type of lens when it comes down to it. And that's just kind of what happens when you're getting these types of tablets, right? These things aren't necessarily supposed to be competing with the top Android phones or top iPhones of this day and age. I have compared the photos and videos from both the front and back cameras with my S24+ and the quality difference is really noticeable. Even for video calls, the quality of the tablet cameras is an issue from my perspective. \nThere's a really big increase in battery life compared to previous versions. The Tab S10 Plus is giving you a 10,090 mAh battery inside and I could notice that it does last at least 3-4 hours longer than other tablets. I think this might have to do with the chipset as well as Samsung has added a newer chipset inside. I believe it was supposed to be giving you that Snapdragon chipset, but on GSM Arena, it's telling me the MediaTek Dimensity chipset. But either way, on the Tab S10 Plus, you're getting 12 GB of RAM and I could run all the games and apps without any issues. I did notice a bit of lag while playing games like Call of Duty etc but nothing significant.\nOverall, I think this is a decent tablet but the initial price seems too high considering the camera performance and processor issues. If you can get it for a deal on Black Friday for around 30-40% off, it will be worth its price."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Incredible machine!!! perfect size for any task, i like tablets for it s mobility, Samsung tabS10+ perfectly suitable for kids homework's, streaming hd movies , playing demanding games and obviously work, especially with support of AI, this is future, our tablet ia always in use, thanks for the long lasting battery, i will always recommend Samsung tablets as they're best in class and will never disappoint!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10+ within 24 hours of ordering.

For people with eyesight problems like myself, it helps tremendously. \n\nIt a long lasting battery which is great for me because I forget to charge things alot. \n\nThe Samsung tab is easy to carry and use on the go. It's also easy to connect to WiFi, Bluetooth and other devices. \n\nIt has a Dolby atmos speaker this is a must for clear and loud sounds. This results in a fantastic experience when listening to music or watching movies. \n\nI'm honestly so amazed by this tablet. It does everything you need it to. I've been telling everyone who I talk to just how fantastic this is for work and home. I was so excited to try this product and it's really exceeded my expectations. Wouldn't expect anything less from Samsung."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a long-time fan of Samsung tablets, having used the Galaxy Tab 8 for years, I am thrilled with the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 10+. This device truly takes things to the next level with its sleek design, stunning display, and powerful AI features. The AI integration, in particular, adds a layer of intelligence and ease that I didn’t know I needed until now—it’s like having a personal assistant at your fingertips. Whether I'm multitasking or just enjoying content, everything is smoother, faster, and more intuitive.\n\nThe display is a noticeable upgrade, making streaming, gaming, and productivity feel immersive and efficient. Battery life is exceptional, and the performance of this device is flawless. It’s the perfect blend of power and portability, and if you're a Samsung lover like me, this tablet is a must-have."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ has been an excellent addition to my tech collection, especially as someone who already owns and loves the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. The integration between the two devices just works without issue, as it allowed for easy syncing and sharing across platforms. As my first Samsung tablet, I’m rather impressed with its capabilities and the overall experience.\n\nPersonally, the thing that stood out to me the most is the 12.4-inch AMOLED display. It is a real showstopper, with crisp visuals and vibrant colours. It doesn't matter if I'm gaming, streaming, or using productivity apps, the 120Hz refresh rate makes for a buttery-smooth experience, I don't think I could ever go back to a 60Hz display. The MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor (my first experience of a MediaTek processor and I'm impressed) and 12GB of RAM make multitasking a breeze, whether I'm switching between apps or using Samsung’s multi-window feature to run multiple apps at once.\n\nI have put this tablet through its paces, especially in gaming, and it hasn’t faltered once. Running a benchmark test (Geekbench specifically) revealed some impressive scores, giving statistical context to just how good this device is for both gaming and productivity. The battery life easily lasts through a full day of normal use. \n\nBeing familiar with the One UI ecosystem, I already found the tablet intuitive and easy to navigate. Though even for beginners, the interface is quite user-friendly, and should be simple for anyone who has some experience with the Android operating system. For creative tasks, I had a lot of fun experimenting with the drawing assist feature, which turned my rough sketch of a pig into a beautiful watercolor artwork which you can see attached to this review—definitely a cool tool for both novices and people more artistic than myself. \n\nOverall, the Galaxy Tab S10+ is a fantastic balance of power, portability, and functionality, perfect for tech enthusiasts like me, and highly recommended for anyone looking to boost productivity or enjoy top-tier entertainment."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently got the Samsung Galaxy S10+ Tablet, and it’s been a game changer for my studies and entertainment. The first thing that stands out is the display. The screen is stunning and makes watching movies and writing notes very easy and immersive.\nAnother shocking feature was the responsiveness of the S-Pen which was very smooth, making it great for note-taking or editing photos. Another cool feature was that the S Pen can be charged in any direction which is very useful. As an avid gamer I also found there to be no lag when using the device for games. Battery life has also been solid, easily lasting me 2 days of moderate use, from browsing and watching videos to gaming. \nNevertheless, there are a few downsides worth mentioning as well. Firstly, the large size makes it a bit bulky and less comfortable to hold for long periods. This can be annoying for casual use, especially without a standing case. Also, the S Pen doesn't have a built-in slot in the tablet itself. This makes it easy to misplace if you're not careful. Despite these minor drawbacks, the S10+ is an impressive tablet that excels in performance and overall functionality. However, it may not be ideal for everyone depending on your specific needs and budget. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a high performance tablet, this is definitely worth considering."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung is no newcomer to the scene of tablets, and with this latest release, the S10+ proves why these tablets are hot-sellers. From the beautiful OLED screen to the punchy AKG Quad speakers and not to mention the new Dimensionality 9300+ Chipset, this is a powerful machine. The battery size will last you a day easily (from experience from my previous S9 tablet!), it will play any multimedia content without hiccups (as it should!) and if you are into productivity features, this tablet does not hold back, especially with the new Galaxy AI features (which I personally do not use, but hey it's a welcome bonus!). Regarding size, the S10+ sits right in the middle of the lineup at 12.4 inches (perfect size for watching Netflix!), it weights about 570grams which is still light and portable. This can also replace a laptop if you buy the Samsung keyboard cover. The moonstone grey colour is great however I prefer the graphite from previous year. The S-Pen, while certainly useful, does not get much use from me. Lastly, if you are upgrading from the S9 series, there are no major changes. I rate it a solid 9.5/10."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S8 tablet to a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, I noticed a huge improvement. The screen quality on the S10 Plus is stunning, especially when viewing videos and playing games. The tablet is extremely fast at loading multiple apps at the same time and switching without any lag or slow down. It's also handy having a microSD slot, as I sometimes prefer saving documents and files for offline viewing. The S Pen has always been a special extra feature from Samsung, and it's so handy for writing or drawing. I have been using the tablet for just over two days and the battery performance is stunning. I would recommend the S10 Plus tablet as a purchase."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have recently bought my first Samsung tablet, which is Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, and immediately felt that this piece could meet all my expectations. The first thing which drew one's attention was a bright, vivid display with rich colors. For a novice photographer, editing photos on such a screen has become a real pleasure.\n\nThis is a tablet that will make your creation easy, using AI. For example, AI will automatically enhance your photos. It will quicken up editing and hence make it easy, especially when one has to work with volumes of images.\n\nActually, that is a great design; slim, light, and stylish. This fits my backpack conveniently, and that is why I carry it with me every day to college. At class, this is really handy for note-taking, viewing of materials, and the stylus works perfectly when it comes to drawing and editing.\n\nThe sound is loud and clear, making it perfect for watching videos and listening to music. The tablet shows just great results: everything opens in an instant, and the battery might easily last all day. Stylish and functional, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus might turn out to be good for a beginning photographer, who is studying and creating."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently purchased the new Samsung Tab S10 Plus and it is an amazing product. Firstly I would like to discuss the Super AMOLED display- it is beautiful and perfect for streaming films and shows. Also I love the added anti reflection screen, which is a bump up from the tab S9 plus, making it perfect for use outside.\n\nI have been using this tablet for a week now and I must say the battery life is fantastic! It lasts me around 1-2 days, which is great for a student and everyday use. Also the device itself is very sleek and thin making it comfortable to use when holding. \n\nMy favourite part of the tablet is the pen- it is really smooth and excellent for drawing. Also the AKG sound system is also very clear. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ is going to be my main device as a student – and I love it! I would definitely recommend it :)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had been waiting for the right time to upgrade in the tablet department and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ looked absolutely ideal in so many aspects for me, so I was super keen to get my hands on this latest device with all the latest features and Galaxy AI powered delights that I enjoy immensely on my Galaxy S24+ smartphone. \n\nI have to say I am absolutely delighted with the Galaxy Tab S10+ in every way and immensley impressed with just how satisfyingly enjoyable it is to use on a daily basis in so many varying use cases also. \n\nIt is built amazingly well, super thin but feels sturdy and holding it you can just feel that it is a quality product. Despite the large size of this tablet, I find it easily accessible to use whether it be kn your lap, on a desk, on the sofa, in bed etc. I\'ve enjoyed its ergonomics and the feel of using it in every setting I\'ve tried it in. \n\nThe 12.4"" Screen obviously takes centre stage and it is just delightful. The 120hz adaptive refresh rate means scrolling webpages, notes and documents silky smooth. \n\nThe screens brightness and colours pop and stand out and honestly I can\'t help but just using it just so I can use and view the screen. There are a variety of display settings aswell so the Vivid level of colours can be adjusted to suit your taste and preference. \n\nSamsungs ONE U.I interface is super clean, intuitive and works brilliantly in this large display. A display which has been absolutely brilliant in terms of using Samsungs multi-tasking features for having several apps open at once or apps in pop-up view, these functionalities means my productivity and creativity have been very efficient and I am able to get so much done without wasting time navigating different menus. \n\nThe Galaxy AI features are amazing. Especially on a screen this size and with the included S Pen, it means using Galaxy AI to edit photos, using circle to search and Sketch to Draw so much fun, but also incredibly useful. Particularly aswell the new Note assist that can help me organise my notes and help them be presented in more streamlined ways. \n\nEverything I\'ve done with the tablet is super responsive., the processor chip is great and with the 12gb RAM I\'m able to do many things at once. \n\nThe speakers are incredible and with the beautiful display on the Galaxy Tab S10+, it makes watching films and media content a joy.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first tablet and I absolutely love it. Starting with the packaging which was so slim down to the unboxing experience, this tablet has been impressive.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra so the Samsung UI and experience is familiar to me. That did make me feel at home. Copying over apps and data was fairly straightforward with the smart switch from Samsung.  After that was all complete,  I tried the speakers with a YouTube video and they are fairly loud and clear for a tablet. The screen quality is also impressive,  watching a 4K YouTube video was very clear. I am yet to try the 120hz display but I can already notice the butter smooth screen which is partially due to the 120Hz display. The camera quality is quite good. As I have only got this tablet today. I'm yet to try nighttime photography. I'm a fairly power user so I'll be trying the battery life as well. As of now, the battery life is good but not exceptional. I've had a 15 mins Google Meet call and about 30 minutes of browsing through the tab and the battery dropped from 80% to 71%. I was hoping that the drop would be half that. Hopefully, the tab will learn my usage and optimise battery based of that. I plugged it into a fast charger and the battery charges really quick. Early days with this tab but overall I'm very impressed. I have a case and a screen protector being delivered tomorrow so from next week I'll start to use the productivity features at my work. Really excited to use the S-pen for note-taking. Until now I have been using my phone's S-pen for note taking which has been okay but not the best."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My previous tablet was the Tab S6 so the Tab s10+ is quite the jump both in perfomance and features. The display is much brighter than previous S Tabs which make using the device outside much better but still not as bright as Samsungs recent phone screens. The 45w fast charging is a welcome addiation compared to the 15w chartging of my older Tab S6. The biggest change I noticed was the 120Hz screen which makes the tablet feel much snappier and fuild compared to older 60Hz screens and along with its large screen size makes the tablet capable of acting as a laptop with the new AI keyboard cover. Editing photos is a breeze on the Tab S10+ with the included AI features and included S-Pen. Very hapopy with the tablet overall and a very good upgrade for anyone on a older Tab S tablet.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Finding an alternative to the current best-in-class tablet has been difficult. But Samsung has dug deep and built a premium tablet that is now the best of its kind. This statement is valid due to the build quality, which feels extremely premium owing to its metal and glass construction yet is remarkably thin! It is paired with a stunning Samsung 12-inch display featuring its beautiful, colour-popping AMOLED technology. The SoC and RAM are top-notch, meaning this tablet is speedy with all tasks. The Mediatek Dimensity 9300+ is a solid choice with the new GPU. It now also excels in gaming and media tasks without issue, and paired with 12 GB of RAM, it never experiences a slowdown. Another feature that puts it ahead of the field is a super-quick and accurate under-display fingerprint reader. This reader keeps your data secure and is paired with a sufficiently good facial unlock for speed, providing you with peace of mind and convenience. For creative tasks, unlike other tablets, it comes with a stylus in the box at no extra charge, allowing you to draw and navigate with ease, which is nice to have and again offers flexibility ahead of the market. The speakers are tuned by AKG and can initially seem quiet, but you can unlock the extra volume and sound options. I downloaded the Samsung Good Lock Sound Manager, which provided me with the extra volume I needed to use the device as a media consumption device. I dare say the One UI Android is now my favourite and preferred version of Android—purest, don’t shoot me! I have tried all the Android skins, and Samsung has finally achieved the perfect level of polish and extensibility. This is accomplished with an excellent overall skin and all the power tweaks that can be unlocked using their “Good Lock” ecosystem. Overall, this tablet is now my primary media consumption device over the previous competition.

Everything about this tablet screams premium, including its screen, included stylus and, (unfortunately), the price. \n\nThis is both a gaming and productivity machine. I have put it through its paces, playing Sim,  racing and first person shooter games. The S10+ did not falter once, with the processor and vivid screen keeping up with the demands with ease. Similarly, I have experimented several times with multitasking on the Tab, watching YouTube videos while browsing the Web, checking emails and even doodling using the PENUP app (which feels eerily natural). \n\nWhile it's more expensive sibling, the S10 Ultra, may take the plaudits due to its larger size,  the S10+ is more than capable to meet the needs of even the most demanding power user. This, however, as alluded to previously, comes at a cost. For the price I would have expected to see a keyboard included as I would have loved to experiment using the S10+ as a genuine replacement for my work laptop while travelling. Alas, the keyboard is another significant investment that I may make further down the line.\n\nAs it is 2024 we can't go far in technology without mentioning the latest buzzword (or should that be buzz acronym) AI. I haven't found much use for Galaxy AI thus far, except when using note taking apps and witnessing it straightening and tidying up my terrible handwriting. I must admit this was rather magical. As with the whole tech sector it will be interesting to see how this evolves. \n\nAt the end of the day, you get what you pay for, and in the case of this tablet, you get class.

I did think there was something missing as the packaging was so slim. It turns out that it does not have a wall charger (A bit annoying as its supposed to be a fast charge tablet and all mines are regular).Shame as you\'d expect the fast charger to be included at this sort of price point. Additionally, it does not have a 3.5mm audio connector for headphones, so I\'ll have to rely on wireless headphones. I prefer the wired option as its one less thing to charge and they are not as easy to lose! \n\nI had an old Samsung S6 Tab Lite which was getting on a bit. I transferred the data from my tablet to the new one. It was quick and easy, although wireless presented some connection problems, in the end I opted to transfer using usb-c to usb-c cable. Once it had finished, almost everything was transferred. Whatsapp and the Microsoft Launcher being the only things that I had to do something manually to get them going..\n\nThe screen is absolutely stunning, everything looks super HD on it. AMOLED screens are excellent at producing high contrast and true black and saving power at the same time. The overall performance of the tablet is blistering, everything I run on it is super fast. \n\nThe sound is amazing too, there are 4 speakers on this tablet. They pump out a lot of sound. Its difficult to believe that the sound is coming from the tablet! I watch YouTube videos on my 24"" Samsung TV. The sound coming from the S9 tablet is easily as loud with noticeably increased bass. \n\nAll in all, this is a very easy tablet to love. Solidly built with excellent performance in the audio and visual departments. I don\'t use my tablets for work/productivity, but I\'m sure its more than capable on that front too (It has more memory than my desktop PC and a newer processor). There is DEX mode to put the tablet into desktop mode which is really useful if you want to use it for work tasks.\n\nTiny niggle Samsung, for the price, please include the fast charger, 3.5mm jack and a protective case to make it perfect.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung has fast become my go to brand for anything tech related as I have never been disappointed. I have been using the Tab S9 WIFI 256BG in beige and I haven\'t been off it since as it has quickly replaced my previous tablet as my day to day tablet. \nThe tablet itself is stunning with a large 11"" crystal clear screen, perfect for watching films or TV shows, or being used as a laptop when combined with a keyboard. Despite its large size this tablet is incredibly lightweight, thin and easy to carry around. Everything runs smoothly with no lagging thanks to the 120 Hz refresh rate.\nThe tablet uses Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 to power it making it one of the fastest on the market. This makes the Tab 9 powerful enough to support any app and games. This tablet also comes with a stylus pen, known as the S pen. This is particularly useful for quickly jotting down notes, which can be saved as is or the tablet can convert handwriting into text form. When not in use the S pen can be stored at the back of the tablet via magnets.  \nOverall I am very impressed with the Tab S9 and once again Samsung has made a fantastic product that is well worth it and much better then others on the market.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tab S9 is a stunning Android tablet.\n\nStraight out of the box, you can sense the quality, with the metal body feeling super high end in the hand.\n\nThe weight is perfect, be it using it during the day or lyign in bed for media consumption.

Combine all this with the keyboard cover and you have a device that is really well ahead in the Android tablet world.\n\nA wonderful device that really shows Samsung in a great light.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Tab S9 is a highly anticipated tablet that has received a lot of attention leading up to its release. As a reviewer, I had the opportunity to test out this tablet and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.\n\nFirstly, the design of the Tab S9 is sleek and modern. It has slim bezels and a large screen, providing an immersive viewing experience. The display itself is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp detail. Whether you're watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, everything looks great on this tablet.\n\nThe performance of the Tab S9 is top-notch. It is powered by a powerful processor and ample amount of RAM, allowing for seamless multitasking and smooth performance. I tested out various apps and games, and everything ran effortlessly. The tablet also has a large battery capacity, so you can use it for extended periods without worrying about running out of power.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Tab S9 is its S Pen. This stylus offers precise control and allows for creative freedom. Whether you're taking notes, drawing, or editing photos, the S Pen provides a natural and intuitive experience. Additionally, the Tab S9 has a built-in storage slot for the S Pen, so you don't have to worry about losing it.\n\nThe Tab S9 also offers a great audio experience, thanks to its quad speakers. The sound is clear and immersive, making it ideal for watching movies or listening to music without needing to use headphones.\n\nOn the software side, the Tab S9 runs on Samsung's One UI, which is smooth and user-friendly. It also supports DeX mode, which transforms the tablet into a desktop-like experience when connected to a keyboard and mouse. This is a convenient feature for productivity tasks.\n\nIn terms of connectivity, the Tab S9 offers Wi-Fi and optional 5G capabilities, so you can stay connected wherever you go. It also has a USB-C port for fast charging and data transfer.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Tab S9 is a fantastic tablet that offers a premium experience. It has a beautiful display, powerful performance, and a great stylus. Whether you're using it for work, entertainment, or creative purposes, the Tab S9 is a versatile and reliable device."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tab S9 series is setting the benchmark for what Android tablets can do. The tablet is built like a tank, but is lightweight and portable, making it really comfortable for extended one-handed use. The S Pen is intuitive and lag-free, especially its air actions. I love that I can control volume and switch between music tracks just by holding the button and waving the S Pen around. I don't even need to be near the tablet to make it work. It's fantastic!\n\nAs expected, performance is excellent. I love being able to split apps across windows and have a floating app when I need it. What's particularly useful is being able to easily use the Tab S9 as a second screen for my laptop - no wires or setup needed. Performance isn't just good for work, though. I paired the Tab S9 with a Bluetooth controller and have been playing games on the tablet itself and using it for remote play on my PlayStation 4. Everything works flawlessly and there's never any lag or connection problems.\n\nPlus, everything just looks amazing on that display! It's bright, vivid, and super smooth, whether you're scrolling through webpages, playing games, or watching movies. The quad-speaker setup is also excellent; the sound is loud and clear, and the bass packs a powerful punch. It's perfect for watching media or playing video games.\n\nAs for the cameras, I didn't think I'd like them as much as I do. The front camera is super wide, which is excellent for video calls and getting lots of people in view without having the tablet far away. And the camera on the back is great for scanning documents and taking pictures that you can mark up with the S Pen. The microphones also do a solid job of focusing on my voice and minimising background noise whenever I'm on a call.\n\nOverall, I'm really impressed by the Tab S9 and can easily see it replacing my laptop as my main computer!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] as expected, another great tablet from Samsung. Crystal clear screen with beautiful vivid colours. Great sound from such a small product. it was super easy to set up and to copy everything across from my other Samsung tablet - it prompts every step of the way so that even those who are not tech savvy will manage it. \nThe settings tab allows you to personalise it, so if large bold fancy font is your thing, just press the setting and save. it is fast to load on startup. there are lots of usefull apps pre installed to get you started and plenty more on galaxy store and play store.the S pen attaches itself to the back with an inbuilt magnet and begins to charge as soon as it connects to the back.\nIt is very easy to connect other products wirelessly, eg wifi printers, bluetooth speakers. By following a few easy steps. You can sent documents to your printer to print. \nConnecting it to a Samsung keyboard and allow the Samsung DeX setting then your lovely little tablet will become a little laptop. \nThere are several options for your choice of search engine.  Its lightweight enough for you to comfortably hold it in one hand when browsing your social media.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tablet has well and truly come of age. What was once seen as a somewhat hobbled computing experience can now offer something akin to laptop-like computing while still delivering a great viewing experience whether watching a movie or playing a game.\n\nIf you’re invested in the Android eco-system and are looking for a portable device with some serious grunt then this year’s Galaxy Tab S9 range has to be top of your list for consideration - available in S9, S9+ and S9Ultra variants rocking 11in, 12.4in or 14.6in screens respectively. You can opt for WiFi-only or 5G connectivity and storage options from 128GB to 1TB.\n\nI took the S9 with 256GB of storage for a spin and even at this comparatively low-end of the range was seriously impressed by the power and smooth operation. This version retailed for £899 at time of review (drawing rough parity with the pricepoints from last year’s S8 range). Some retailers are offering trade-in and the Slim Book Cover keyboard thrown in to sweeten the deal.\n\nUpgrades this time around mean AMOLED 2x screens across the range, with the S9 featuring a dynamically switching refresh rate and eye comfort baked in with a 16:10 aspect ratio. Elsewhere you’ll find an upgraded processor (an overclocked Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2), bigger quad speakers featuring Dolby Atoms, IP68 and improved dust and water resistance. \n\nThe Tab S9 body is reinforced with Armour Aluminium and the range is available in two colours: Beige and Graphite.  The inclusion of the S Pen stylus which a magnet can hold neatly in place on the rear of the device is truly transformative. Professional creators can also opt for a S Pen with a material design and wider tilt angel. The fact I’m still using a Tab S3 regularly is testament to just how useful it is as both an input device and the ability to parse scrawl to text makes this ideal for notes. \n\nMulti Window, DeX, and Second Screen functions make this a pleasure to use if you’re looking for a laptop-like device and the inclusion of GoodNotes for note taking and LumaFusion for video editing add to the creative possibilities.\n13Mp rear and 12Mp front cameras (with ultrawide cams on the + and Ultra) allow for the communicative possibilities we’ve come to expect while battery sizes are between 8400mAh and 11,200mAh making it possible to hit the road and power your day fairly successfully.\n\nAll in all, if you’re looking for a portable computing device that delivers stunning entertainment, plays nicely with other An', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This s9 256gb wifi product arrived in a thin box slightly deeper than the tablet itself. \n\nIt comes with \nTablet itself\nA usb c charger wire\nWarranty manual and details\nNew style s pen in colour matching tablet\npin to extract the sim card slot for micro sd.\n\nFirst thoughts are its a good size diagonally and depth which make it easy to hold. The aluminium feel feels very sturdy and the screen bezel is about 1cm so you have most of the tablet size as usable screen real estate.\n\nIt utilises android as an os so is very similar to android phone users meaning little to no difficulty switching to this device.\n\nThe setup process allows easy transfer drom a different device and made transfer easy. For image purposes, the new device setup was just as easy and it guides you through a linear process.\n\nThe pen feels sturdy and connects well to the device, the responsiveness for basic use and notes was highly efficient so im sure it would be fine with more finicky tasks like drawing albeit I didnt test this.\n\nI tested this briefly by dipping it in the sink and it is still responsive with the pen, finger not so much. I wouldn't trust it for prolonged use in water but using in the bath and having that accidental drop shouldn't phase it. If you wish for more intense water use, i would advise a waterproof case for that extra layer of protection.\n\nI personally really liked the device and its responsiveness is very similar to the galaxy book range.\n\nI would recommend id you want a nice quality item with a high premium feel then this is for you, i do however feel it is a pricey device but it definitely feels the price value to quality for this price range a product.\n\nThe waterproof feature is a new publish for tablets so if you want the latest and greatest, look no further."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I took the Samsung Tab S9 for a spin to see how the latest Android tablet fares in comparison to the competition out there. The S9 is the smallest of the new tablet offerings from Samsung at 11”, with the S9+ and S9 Ultra also available at 12.4” and 14.6” (!) screens respectively. \n\nThankfully Samsung hasn’t sacrificed specs as you go down in sizes (which some manufacturers are guilty of doing), with all three having the same screen tech, processor, camera module (the bigger tablets have additional lenses but the main sensor is the same across the range) and water/dust resistance, so I didn’t feel like I compromised the experience by choosing the smallest of the three flavours.\n\nFirstly the Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is incredible. Movies and photos look stunning with deep blacks and colours that really pop. The refresh rate maxes out at 120Hz so everything feels really fluid when in use. Compared to other top end tablets from other manufacturers out there, I’d say this is the best tablet screen you can buy on the market right now.\n\nPerformance is equally impressive with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on board. The dock function at the bottom of the screen allows you to switch between apps instantly and I was impressed with how instant the apps responded after switching between them, with little to no lag perceivable.\n\nThe other feature that has impressed me is the inclusion of the S Pen that snaps on the back of the tablet so that a) you don’t lose it and b) it charges the pen when not in use. I intend to use the tablet as a note taking device with an upcoming course I’m enrolled in, as the handwriting and note taking ability is excellent.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use my tablet mainly for reading, web browsing and online shopping. Also content consumption i.e. youtube, netflix etc and a little bit of light gaming. The majority of this is done at home either on the sofa or in bed and as such I find the smaller of the three S9 range of tablets to be most suited to my particular use case. The device feels extremely well built having a solid feel in hand. It looks and feels impossibly thin whilst at the same being comfortable to hold in hand and use. The screen has great colour reproduction and high resolution/HDR content from either youtube or Netflix looked amazing on this tablet, and for such a small device the sound from it was a pleasant surprise. I'm not really much of an artist but I let my daughter try her hand at creating an artistic masterpiece to test out the pen capability which was easy to setup and use. There's plenty of options in the settings to configure exactly for my requirements and I was happy to see options to cast content from the device to a larger screen wirelessly. I will continue to use this device as a companion to my smart phone as the two devices also seem well optimised to work well with one another. Overall I'm suitably impressed and still can't get over over thin and light it is!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having owned both the Tab S6 and Tab S7, I knew what to expect but the Tab S9 has exceeded all expectations. The design is very sleek and easy on the eye. It's very fast, with an amazing display (seems a significant improvement). I've always like the Android interface and it's easy to customise the home screens with any number of widgets. Transferring data from previous tablets was very straightforward. The sound is fantastic, particularly with Dolby Atmos enabled. The  S-pen makes accurate writing and drawing incredibly easy. This is a step up from previous models and another win for Samsung!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first decent tablet. When it arrived it came in a nice sturdy box.  In the box was the tablet, charging lead , stylus pen and a pin.  The first thing to know is there is no plug and the charging cable is a C-connection at both ends. Once charged I switched on. Instantly the graphics is noticeably sharp and clear. Setting up the system was easy enough to follow and I was able to Smart share apps and info from my phone onto to the tablet.  My main use would be for reading emails, internet searching and playing games. The s pen is charged by being attached to the back of the tab which takes roughly an hour. The pen is fun to use, you are able to write to text, scrolling and general indication.  The speed of page loading and movement is great.  This is a very neat stylish tablet with great capacity and imaging. Far handier for transporting than a laptop. I was able to get a case to put it in.  Connecting a keyboard would be a smart move if typing was a big necessity.  I know there's plenty more for me to find out about the Tab9 but what I've seen so far has been worth the money. Great quality, slender, light and jazzy."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my third Samsung Galaxy tab and definitely the best one so far, it has far exceeded my expectations. I mainly use the tablet for emails, browsing, shopping and streaming videos.\nThe screen resolution is absolutely fantastic, a big step up from my previous model in my opinion. It has made a big difference to my viewing experience when streaming video content. The sound quality is also premium. It doesn't have a headphone jack, but I found it really easy to connect it to my wireless headphones. \nIt comes with an S-pen, which attaches easily to the tablet for convenient access. I will probably rarely have the need to use it, but it's a handy accessory to have.\nI found it really easy to transfer content over to this one from my previous tablet and sync it with my Galaxy phone. \nThe tablet is very thin, light and sleek, giving the appearance of a premium product.\nThe battery life, so far, is great, it appears to be a significant improvement to my previous tablet, although I have had that for a while now. With reasonable use, it will last me significantly longer than my previous model, this is a great bonus for me. \nIt's very responsive, quick and easy to navigate. If you are familiar with Samsung Galaxy products, then you will find the settings quite easy to use and tailor to your preference. \nIf you have access to a keyboard, it's really easy to convert it into a mini-laptop for light office work etc. \nOverall, I am really pleased with my purchase and I am sure I will get plenty of quality use out of it for quite some time to come. Highly recommended."", 'I bought this for my Husbands birthday and he is thrilled with it.

I've combined it with a Bluetooth keyboard but am using the pen only 95% of the time. The screen is proving super accurate and battery life is great. I like how it syncs up we with my S22U too.

It has a 12.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage. It also has an S Pen stylus, a 10,090mAh battery, and a rear-facing dual-camera system.\n\nThe display is bright and colorful, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and animations smooth and fluid. The 16:10 aspect ratio of the Tab S9+ makes it a great tablet for media consumption, with the on screen video extremely immersive thanks to the narrow bezels and that wider aspect ratio. Its not just media consumption that looks great, gaming is also fantastic with bright, vibrant colours and fluid motion all creating an extremely immersive and satisfying experience. \n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor is flawless and every interaction is snappy and stutter free, meaning that you can be productive and multitask with ease. It comes with an S Pen included in the box, which is accurate and responsive, making it great for taking notes, drawing, or signing documents.

Having a tablet from a competitor for a few\n\n years now and tried this new Samsung tab s9+ I was blown away by its screen and built quality. So much lighter than my previous one and felt more premium to hold. It’s my first android tablet and it never disappoint. I’m glad I bought one of these when it’s launched. The multi tasking and storage expansion is just amazing which I don’t have much on my previous one. Screen quality is superb especially when I’m outside. \n\nI’ve got the gray colour one which looks very nice! I love its S-pen that’s included in the package. It feels like writing on a paper while using it. Feels so good really writing notes on this table. \n\nIt’s freaking fast too! With its latest processor and software and ram it works very well with heavy loads of open tabs and games. \n\nWould highly recommend this tablet if you’re looking one. I would say it’s the best in the market!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The first thing you notice about the tablet is the screen when it turns on. The AMOLED screen is so bright and clear even in full sunlight. Text is very clear and watching some videos online show that the screen can handle anything thrown at it exceptionally well.\nWith regard to the size i would say the tab 9+ is pretty much perfect, not heavy in the slightest and definitely well balanced when holding it with one hand. The form factor and thinness of the bezels means that the screen real estate is maximised. \nThe S Pen is very easy to use and almost feels like you are writing on paper. You are afforded great control and even using the S pen instead of a mouse or your fingers it feels intuitive. It also can be magnetically attached to the back of the device so that you cannot misplace it easily.\nThe fact that the device runs on Android makes it very easy to pick up run with if you use Android on your mobile. Indeed, during the setup process, it asks you if you want to share your settings from your phone to the tab 9+ and this then automatically downloads apps and settings onto your new device. You are therefore, very quickly up and running with your favourite apps.\nOverall, the tablet is a fantastic piece of kit and the family are already using it for various tasks. I would highly recommend the device as you won’t be disappointed.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Impressive on opening, it\'s lightweight, super thin aluminium with gorilla glass, clear and rich sound from AKG speakers along with Atmos for gaming. Crystal clear 12.4"" screen with no lag. Easy to set up with my Samsung S22 Ultra. The s pen is responsive and easy to use it attaches and charges on the rear of the tablet. There\'s a micro sd slot if you find you need it. It\'s IP68 so waterproof which is handy in Scotland!\nI chose the beige colour which is actually a soft gold and in my opinion looks good. All positives. I\'m looking forward to seeing what else Samsung have hidden away in this little gem.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impression of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ is that it is a wonderful machine. The set up was very straight forward and it took less than 10 minutes to transfer all the files from my last tablet. The screen resolution is impressive and I find myself noticing more details than I thought possible when watching streaming services. The controls are very straightforward and I like now responsive the fingerprint ID lock is.\n\nI haven't used the S Pen much but from what I've tried it is very easy to draw with and the pen easily glides along the screen and is very responsive. When not using the pen it's secured to the back of the tablet by a magnetic strip which also charges the pen and feels very secure so the pen won't just randomly fall off the tablet.\n\nOverall it's a very good well rounded tablet with lots of great features and an amazing super responsive screen."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had the S9+ for just over a week now and I am very impressed. My 2 previous tablets have been smaller more budget tablets so it is a serious upgrade. I decided on the S9+ as I thought it was the “Goldilocks” options between the 3 models. The S9 was perhaps too small for my intended use while the Ultra was a bit excessive.\nMy usage at the moment is heavy so the battery probably isn't lasting me as long as it will. Having said that, it's currently predicting just over 4 days between charges. Something that's great about the battery is that if it’s at 50% when I go to sleep, when I get back to the S9+ the next day, it's still on 50%.\nI'm loving the S pen and I've not had issues with it not recognising what I was writing which is something I had been concerned about. I have noticed a slight drop in accuracy now I have installed a screen protector. Nothing major, as it's still very responsive, but there has been enough of a change that I have noticed. The magnet that holds the S Pen to the back of the tablet feels very secure and you have to give it a satisfying little tug to pull it off.\nThe split screen function is very useful. I've used split screen on other devices but I've found that the screen has been too small to really make the most of this feature but on the crisp 12.4 inch display of the S9+, it's ideal.\nThoroughly enjoying the S9+. I've learnt the basics and I'm still discovering new things the more I use it!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a piece of equipment.  It comes packed in a slim and smart box and once you get past the protective cover you realise what a lovely piece of technology the S9+ really is.   First thing you notice is how great it looks, sleek, delicate and lovely to hold also.   It has a beautiful screen and once you hold the S Pen you realise this product really means business.   The S9+ is very well finished round the edges with the power button and volume fitting very neatly around one side.   In addition, the dock for syncing and charging the SPen is another lovely touch and suits the overall design.  Unlike previous tablets, the SPen can charge when facing either direction so this idea works very well indeed.       \nGoing into a bit more detail, the S9+ is great whether you are using it for work or play.   It has power to spare, a battery that takes a long time to go down and you don't ever feel like you are left wanting.    The stylus even comes with an IP 68 rating meaning it can stand up to both dust and water down to a metre if you ever end up in that situation.(hopefully not)\nThe screen is one of the first things you notice about this tablet.  It is clear, detailed and you'd need a magnifying glass to notice any pixels.   This screen certainly doesn't let you down.  You don't noticeably suffer from glare and the sound also copes well in most situations.   Bass cauld perhaps be a little deeper in areas but on the whole it's a great sounding tablet.\nBuild quality and design are both very high and whilst it can get hot at times, the tablet cools itself so it doesn't get too hot.   It is very sleek to look at and the back of it is a very nice gun metal grey which suits the overall product.   Due to it's size it can be a little challenging to hold so a stand or case probably comes in useful here.\nAnother useful feature is that you can open numerous functions or apps and these can be run alongside each other.  \nThe rear camera takes lovely pictures in both day and nght time.  Pictures are crisp, detailed and colours are vibrant.   \nFinally, the battery gives you plenty of operating time.  It can handle games and videos well.   Whilst you are supplied with a charging cable a wall charger is not included.        \nHaving used a laptop for most of my work a tablet does take some getting used to however the S9+ works well in so many areas and is certainly a product that won't disappoint."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am really happy with overall feel and look of the tablet. It is not clunky or heavy. \nThe design with the pen magnetising to the back is a great idea, but you require a case to keep it safe.\nThe functionality of the tablet is very smooth and the screen quality is top notch.\nAs a user of android with my mobile phone the setup was very easy and with a scan of a qr code the tablet was fully setup within few minutes including it getting connected to a wife which I thought was amazing.\nThe battery life on it is exceptional, I have used it for a week now and only had to charge it once. I use it evert night.\nOverall very happy and highly recommend to anyone looking for a new tablet. You can't go wrong with this."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The newest range of flagship tablets from Samsung offers models in 3 different screen sizes. The S9 at 11”, The S9+ at 12.4” and the S9 Ultra at 14.6”and this year they all offer the same Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor and new for this year they are even IP68 water and dust-resistance.\n\nFor me the S9+ offers the best screen size at 12.6” its screen is bigger than most other tablets on the market making it great for watching content or doing work. I even use mine when I am on the train meaning I can start work on the train before I have even arrived at the office and have paired it with the Slim Book Cover Keyboard meaning I can use it to its full potential in DEX mode and use it as a laptop. Additionally, when at home I have discovered that I can also connect it to my main windows computer using the second screen feature, meaning the S9+ then acts as a monitor for my main computer. Meaning this tablet truly is ideal for both at home and on the go.\n\nI am also very impressed that Samsung have decided to ensure the S9 range of tablets are water and dust resistant including the S Pen, while initially most people might think this is an unnecessary feature since most people will rarely use tablets outside, for me this has offered the extra assurance that I can carry it around in my bag without worrying about water or dust damaging it, this combined with their Armor Aluminium frame means the tablet should last for years to come.\n\nOverall, I think the Galaxy Tab S9 Lineup really does offer a tablet suitable for everyone and would advise anyone considering purchasing one to consider what you will be using it for to decide the best model for your usage case, however for me the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ is the ultimate tablet!!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy S9+ tablet, and I must say, the opening and first use experience left me thoroughly impressed. The sleek design and vibrant display immediately caught my attention, making it a pleasure to interact with. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the intuitive interface and clear instructions.\n\nOne standout feature is its seamless integration with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphone. The ability to link the two devices has proven incredibly useful. Not only can I easily transfer files and messages between them, but the shared ecosystem enhances my productivity. I can start a task on one device and seamlessly continue it on the other, offering a level of convenience that's truly impressive.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S9+ tablet's performance, combined with its integration with the Galaxy S23 Ultra, has undoubtedly elevated my digital experience. It's a testament to Samsung's commitment to innovation and user-centric design."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been an avid user of Samsung tablets for years, and the Galaxy Tab S9+ WiFi has truly taken my tablet experience to the next level. From the moment I started using it, I was captivated by its exceptional performance and stunning display. The sleek design and slim profile make it incredibly easy to carry around, whether I'm using it for work or entertainment.\n\nOne of the standout features for me is the breathtaking 12.4-inch Super AMOLED display.

It's incredibly responsive and accurate, making note-taking and creative tasks feel natural and intuitive. The tablet's battery life is also commendable, I can go through an entire day of usage without worrying about running out of power.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the Galaxy Tab S8+ WiFi, the Tab S9+ (and the included S Pen) boasts several noticeable improvements. The Main one being the IP Rating (It is this feature that made me switch from S8+ to S9+). Even Though i understand people may not see this as a much bigger improvement, but when I am spending that sort of money, having the IP68 Rating bring in added piece of mind. The colour reproduction in outer condition is another improvement over its predecessor. The New Chipset is also another significant area of improvement. \n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ WiFi has exceeded my expectations in every way. Its cutting-edge features, powerful performance, and sleek design make it a top-tier tablet on the market.

It's a true testament to Samsung's commitment to innovation and excellence."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ is a pricey tablet but it does many things right to justify its high cost.\n\nComing from a Xiaomi Redmi Pad, the Galaxy Tab S9+ feels like a tablet that's several generations newer.  Starting with the build quality and feel of the tablet, in a word, is phenomenal!  The alumunium frame and back looks and feels fantastic.  The 2 rear cameras slight protrude but that's no big issue.  There's also a convenient magnetic strip on the rear for storing the included stylus.\n\nMoving on to the screen, the 12.4 inch Dynamic AMOLED screen is the best I've seen on any tablet.  With fantastic colour accuracy and a high 120Hz refresh rate, I've happily used my Galaxy Tab S9+ for watching TV shows and movies instead of my LG OLED.  That leads me on to the speakers which sound surprisingly full and bassy from such a thing tablet.\n\nGeneral performance of the tablet is also amazing.  It uses the a custom, slightly overclocked version of the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SOC which performed flawlessly in every app I've used.  With 12Gb of RAM, multitasking with several apps open caused no issues whatsoever.  I've also tried out the Samsung Dex interface with a bluetooth keyboard and it makes the Galaxy Tab S9+ into an actual Windows laptop competitor.  \n\nIn conclusion, while the Galaxy Tab S9+ pricey, similar in cost to an Ipad Pro, it certainly justifies its cost with a best in class screen, performance and other useful features.  I can see myself using this tablet for a long time."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung's Galaxy Tab S9 Plus has quickly become my preferred new tablet toy. It strikes an impeccable balance between compact size and a display that feels just right - not too cramped or oversized. I bought it to be used strictly for work and become a family entertainment. \nOpening the box of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Plus comes with little inside the box. You won't find a charger inside, but you get a Galaxy Tab S9 Plus tablet, S Pen stylus, USB-C charging cable, Leaflets and manuals.\nMy personal preference is to have a keyboard as well for better performance. \nThe Galaxy Tab S9 Plus is made of Armor Aluminium, extremely thin and lightweight, representing a modern design masterpiece. It is perfect for watching movies, note-taking and light graphic work.\nWhat I like is the complete IP68 dust and water protection.

The sounds are okay; you will enjoy them when watching movies but do not expect the best performance while listening to the music. \nGalaxy Tab S9 Plus Display. The Galaxy Tab S9 Plus is here to delight you. Sporting a generous 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen gives you a fluid 60-120Hz refresh rate, impressive brightness, and a satisfying resolution. With an aspect ratio of 16:10, the display balances width and height, offering an immersive canvas for indulging in movies and TV shows. In practical use, the tablet's display lives up to its promise; however, when used outside, you might like to have a mat screen to avoid reflexes.\nGalaxy Tab S9 Plus Battery. A 10,090mAh battery keeps the lights on, which, paired with the new chip on board, allows the tablet to last for a long time. The Galaxy Tab S9 plus battery should last a day, consisting of mixing usage. The Galaxy Tab S9 Plus charges fully in roughly 3 hours. There is no charger in the box; you must supply your own.\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy TabS9 Plus is a great tool both for fun and work, a bit pricy, but this time is “you get what you pay for.”"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a machine, having used this so far for work, gaming, videos and general day to day tasks I can safely say this is the best tablet I've owned yet\nThe screen is absolutely stunning, deep inky blacks paired enough peak brightness to make HDR highlights pop.\n\nThe 16:10 aspect is great, giving the ideal compromise for both media consumption and multi-tasking/productivty. Makes the perfect secondary display when being used with a windows laptop (doesn't have to be Samsung for this feature).\n\nIf you're using it standalone and need to get some work done, slap a keyboard/mouse case on it and load up DEX, it's desktop-like environment allowing you to multi-task just as you would on Windows. Even opening almost every Office app including Teams, Citrix and a lot of browser tabs, I was never close to maxing the 12GB RAM.\n\nS-Pen has been amazing for taking notes, annotating and signing documents.\nExtremely responsive and will work even if you forget to actually charge it on the back of the tablet as only the button functions need charge\nConnect a Samsung phone to it and calls/texts can be taken straight from the tablet.\nIf using 2FA for work, the shared clipboard is super handy to copy from the phone and paste to the tablet seamlessly\n\nIn terms of media consumption, the speakers are fantastic for this form factor.\nBe sure to enable Dolby Atmos as this is not turned on out of the box, that really expands the soundstage and makes it a lot more immersive.\nAs mentioned the screen is absolutely amazing and the CPU in this can handle everything you throw at it from Game Pass to Genshin Impact without skipping a beat.\n\nBattery life so far has been good at about 8 -10 hours of screen on time depending on my usage.\n\nIf you need a tablet that looks and feels premium, can be used for work, play and everything in between, this is it."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve been using the Samsung Galaxy Tab 9+ for several weey now, and I\'m incredibly impressed with its performance and features.

Despite how thin it is, I wasn't pleasantly surprised that neither the battery life and general speed at which it undertakes day to day tasks have been compromised. To the contrary, the s9+ is remarkably smooth and loads apps and websites faster than any android device I've used and on par with my laptop. In fact, Samsung have included an option to use the tablet in a 'desktop' like experience using a mode called DeX, which works very well when connected to a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.\n\nOn to my favourite thing about this tablet; the display. It is bright, punchy, incredibly detailed and runs smoothly at a high frame rate. I did fibd myself needing to invest in Samsung's anti-reflection screen cover as I often use the Tablet during train journeys and the constant reflections were a distraction. I'm happy to say this completely resolved the issues and in fact I find I can now comfortably view the display at a significantly lower brightness level, helping battery.\n\nSamsung have thrown the kitchen sink at this tablet to ensure they cover the needs of any user. For business users it's an excellent conferencing device with a high quality set of cameras, loud and crisp speakers and an array of microphones. For creatives, there is the S Pen which I enjoyed using from time to time but ended up leaving it in a drawer as it cannot be stored inside the tablet.\n\nI'm highly recommend the S9+ to anyone looking for a all singing and all dancing productivity and media powerhouse that is unapologetically premium, but you might find another tablet that satisfies a more limited use case at a lower price point."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Samsung tablet is the best yet!

I was undecided  about it for ages.. BUT, what a game changer ... My Lenovo gave up the ghost, and after an operation I had to rest, so I watched   that in bed, but it was strain for my eyes. This one, well no eye strain, no need for glasses. It is very fast, my Daughter set it up in minutes (Teenager.! ) Paired up with a Bluetooth speaker.. My handy T.V, check emails, etc. Came with the stand and pen. The best part was, I got it when it was on offer £100 cheaper at  £299.99... But.. I had a Argos voucher for £289.99...

It looks sleek and stylish and the build quality is really good. It's so easy to set up and transfer all your data from other devices - I was particularly impressed and relieved as I had lost my phone the day this arrived but once I started the set up, everything was quickly transferred from my phone, even down to my morning alarm settings, so I still had access to all my emails, apps, etc.\n\nI like that I have the different screen modes, depending on what I'm doing. I mostly use the paper mode as it's great for my artwork but also makes it easier to see the screen in different lighting. It's also gentler on the eyes if you use your tablet for reading. The screen colours are vibrant and clear. Functionality is excellent, everything runs well with no lagging and it's easy to navigate the settings and functions.\n\nThe size of the screen is fantastic. If you're used to scrolling through photos on your phone or smaller tablet this will really take your experience up a notch or two. Being able to see your photos at this scale is great, and it's so much easier to read ebooks and magazines, as well as other content, with such a generously sized screen.\n\nBattery life is excellent, it's so good not having to constantly check whether it needs charged and it's great if you're not going to be near a power point for a period of time.

It handles everything without breaking a sweat. It’s fast, responsive, and I haven’t noticed any lag or stuttering, even with demanding tasks.\n\nI also went ahead and used it for some light gaming – played a few rounds of  Genshin Impact and  Call of Duty Mobile – and the graphics look amazing.

Build quality is amazing, the device is super thin but feels sturdy and holding it you can just feel it\'s premium quality. Despite the large size of this tablet, it is easily accessible to use whether it be on your lap, desk, or on the sofa, in bed etc. I\'ve enjoyed its ergonomics and the feel of using it in every setting I\'ve tried it in. The 12.4"" Screen obviously takes centre stage and it is just delightful. The 120hz adaptive refresh rate means scrolling webpages, notes and documents silky smooth. The screens brightness and colours pop and stand out and honestly I can\'t help but just using it just so I can use and view the screen. There are a variety of display settings aswell so the Vivid level of colours can be adjusted to suit your taste and preference. Samsungs ONE U.I interface is super clean, intuitive and works brilliantly in this large display. A display which has been absolutely brilliant in terms of using Samsungs multi-tasking features for having several apps open at once or apps in pop-up view, these functionalities means my productivity and creativity have been very efficient and I am able to get so much done without wasting time navigating different menus. The Galaxy AI features are amazing.

The speakers are incredible and with the beautiful display on the Galaxy Tab S10+, it makes watching films and media content a joy.', ""It's just beautiful speedy and love the keyboard amazing."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have to say, I was a little nervous using this device and a little bit sceptical as Samsung has moved away from Snapdragon processors. However, the Dimensity 9300+ processor is holding up on its own. From multitasking on the tablet with emails and browsing whilst playing YouTube video as a third application running at the same time, it handles it perfectly. No heating issues; everything runs buttery smooth. The large screen is just a dream to work with, and the anti-reflection screen makes working with the tablet in sunny conditions oh so beautiful. I have to say it is a game changer for me. The S Pen works its magic as always in all Samsung products, but the integration of AI with Samsung just makes everything so much better. From summarising my notes and emails to editing in Multiview and letting AI make all the changes. It just takes so much more time off my production in working. To top it off, circle to search on the big S10 Ultra with the S pen works like it was made for this device only! I am so happy with this device that I am not sure I need a laptop anymore. Any workflow application that I need to run works perfectly. But also enhanced experience with Samsung DEX.

I cannot recommend this device enough for general entertainment in such a large and light device, amongst using it as a tablet for work. Offer a great balance to both lifestyles. The combination with the anti-reflection screen and the S pen is just highly recommended to all! You will not be disappointed.\xa0', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this as an upgrade from the already excellent s9 ultra from 2023. I knew beforehand the changes were minimal but I’m a sucker for the latest tech! To start the presentation of the tablet is excellent in a sturdy but minimalist sleek white box which precedes the astonishingly thin and lightweight but extremely powerful and capable tablet within. Immediately the first major difference between the s9 and s10 is the new anti reflective coating on the newer s10 screen. Whilst for most this would be barely noticeable having both side by side the s10 really does an amazing job at rejecting glare and reflections. Powering up the tablet the software is familiar which is no bad thing there have been some minor tweaks to the layout however the major additions are the ai focused features. It’s early days and I’ve not had much time to fully test all of the software but suffice to say the additions are welcome and I’m sure will boost productivity in the long term.

The tablet is unreal. It's so thin there is barely room for the usb port to charge it, and the screen rivals my high end Samsung AMOLED TV. It's simply superb. The speed of the device is incredible, and the integration with other Samsung devices make the whole experience seamless. My phone and TV, now easily linked with my tablet and notebook. The pen is included and it's so useful, for simple note taking all the way through to art and drawing. I find it really useful as a mindfulness tool when a bit stressed out, Colouring etc. the battery is superb, I used it lots in a few days and had well over 69% battery left which is fantastic. As for gaming!! Amazing. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this item."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 is a captivating fusion of technology and art, perfect for anyone who appreciates the finer things in both realms. The standout feature of this tablet is its display, a veritable masterpiece. Its Super AMOLED screen boasts stunning colours and deep blacks, creating a canvas that feels alive. For art lovers, this means vibrant, accurate colour reproduction, whether you’re viewing high-resolution art or working on a digital sketch. The details are crisp, and the brightness levels make every brushstroke or image feel immersive, even in bright lighting conditions.\n\nThe resolution is a triumph, allowing for an incredibly detailed viewing experience. Watching a movie or examining high-quality photographs is akin to seeing them in a gallery - sharp and precise. The display is also quite large, offering plenty of space for creative expression, especially if you pair it with the S Pen, which feels smooth and responsive on this display. \n\nWhen it comes to performance, the Galaxy Tab S10 excels in a way that complements the display's brilliance. Powered by a robust processor, it handles multitasking with ease, allowing for seamless transitions between apps. Whether you’re editing large image files, rendering 3D models, or streaming high-resolution video, the tablet’s performance is smooth and efficient. There’s a fluidity to how the tablet moves between artistic pursuits, whether you’re editing photos, sketching, or enjoying media.\n\nIn essence, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 is not just a device but a creative tool. Its display quality is visually stunning, while its performance offers the speed and power to back it up. For those who value aesthetics as much as they do functionality, this tablet feels like a work of art itself."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra Tablet is an absolute joy, and not just because it's a techie’s dream come true - it’s a powerhouse of innovation and functionality. Let’s start with the S Pen - it feels almost too real, like you're back to good ol' pen and paper. Taking notes, sketching doodles, or making lists feels completely natural, and when you’re done, the magnetic attachment keeps it snugly in place, eliminating the usual worry of misplacing it.\n\nThe build quality is exceptional - sleek, slim, and surprisingly comfortable to hold, even though it’s quite large. Speaking of size, it can be a bit unwieldy. Holding it in one hand for extended periods might start to feel like a mini workout, but that’s part of the trade-off for such a massive, stunning display. The screen is nothing short of breathtaking - bright, sharp, and detailed, making it perfect for streaming, creative work, or simply scrolling through social media. Watching movies or diving into creative projects feels immersive, almost like having a personal cinema or art studio right in your hands.\n\nPerformance-wise, it’s fast. There’s no lag, no glitches - just buttery smooth operation, even when multitasking with multiple apps open. The front and back cameras are surprisingly good for a tablet, though realistically, most people won’t be using it as their primary camera. It’s great for video calls or a quick snap, but shooting with a screen of this size can feel a bit awkward.\n\nThere are a few downsides, however. The size makes it tricky to use comfortably on the go without a stand or case to prop it up. Additionally, it’s not the most budget-friendly option - it feels premium in every way, but you’re certainly paying for that level of quality. The S Pen, while fantastic, can sometimes feel a little fragile when magnetically attached, so you need to be careful not to knock it loose when handling the tablet.\n\nBattery life is decent, but not groundbreaking. While moderate users will likely get through a day with ease, heavy multitaskers or binge-watchers might find themselves reaching for the charger sooner than they’d prefer.\n\nLastly, Samsung earns points for the minimalist packaging - just what you need to get started, with no unnecessary extras.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra is a creative powerhouse with a stunning display, excellent performance, and a natural, intuitive S Pen experience. It’s big and bold, with a few trade-offs in portability and cost."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] With much anticipation, today finally arrived where i could get my hands on the S10 Ultra Tab.

You can select text to summarise quickly, run a spell check (which also helped with grammar) or make doodles more appealing! Editing images has also been interesting, and it's surprisingly quick and easy to create with. \n\nThe ability to draw on this tablet was really important to me, and it's such an enjoyable experience. The tip of the S Pen makes drawing a pleasure, as it feels more natural compared with a plastic nib. The pressure sensitivity worked really well for me, as well as the palm rejection.
