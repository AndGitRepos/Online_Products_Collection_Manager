It has become part of my daily routine for a hot or cold caffeine fix. The brews are always perfect and it was so easy to set up and use. I love having friends over to give a coffee to - I feel like a barista!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m quite good with tech but I was fairly intimidated by this coffee machine when I took it out of its box. The instructions seemed tricky and I had to really motivate myself to get around to setting it up. I needn’t have worried because the machine is very intuitive and once you plug it in, it more or less talks you through the whole set up process, which isn’t complicated after all! Initially it took a while to make a coffee which we thought was better than average; top tip - use the best beans you can afford as this makes the most difference in flavour. I found that we had to persevere for a while adjusting the settings of how much milk/bean strength etc for each type of coffee until we were really happy but this is really the machines strong point; you can adjust everything to your exact taste. Then you save your preferences so once you’re happy, you don’t need to adjust it again unless you want to. The flat white we have found to be the tastiest of all the options. Very cleverly, you can also make iced coffees which I was concerned would not be cold enough but they are. You can even adjust the machine to fit a travel cup under the spouts so you can make a coffee to go, which is a feature that I’ve never seen before. The machine itself is quite big and although it fitted on my worktop there wasn’t much clearance between it and the wall cupboards so I put it where there was nothing above it so it was easier to add coffee beans which go in the top. It’s very easy to clean and gives you a notification when the coffee grounds and drip tray need emptied. Lots of the parts are able to go in the dishwasher such as the milk containers so this is helpful too.  The machine is definitely on the pricier end of the market and you need to invest some time into getting it set up to match your own preferences but now this is done, I can say that I wouldn’t want to be without it!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had the Eletta Explore for a month now and I will never buy anything else.\r\nI previously had a Nespresso which I thought was great but this machine is amazing.\r\nIts so easy to use.\r\nIt turns on from the button on top and it tells you what to do - how much milk to add, fill up the water, empty the drip tray ect. \r\nIt guides you through each function - for example after you've made a coffee it will come up with a message saying turn dial (on the milk container) to clean setting and it self cleans!\r\nIt all comes apart easily for cleaning and I love the fact it tells you to empty the drip tray or fill up with water when it's low.\r\nThe touch screen function is great.\r\nIt has such a variety of things it can make.\r\nI use mine for hot coffee - I use Taylor's coffee beans which are nice.\r\nIt comes with a travel cup which is great for a morning coffee on my way to work.\r\nThis coffee machine is just fantastic and so easy to use I would recommend to any coffee lover."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Eletta Explore by De Longhi is a Stylish, sophisticated yet easy to operate bean to cup coffee machine with which you can have Barista style coffees in a few clicks of a button at home.\r\n\r\nFirst thing we noticed when opening the box was a lot of different boxes and parts to put together. This would have been overwhelming except for the fact they provided a handy little quick start guide, which is extremely easy to understand and sets out exactly what you are supposed to do and what all the boxes and parts provided are needed for. This nice quick start guide helped us set up and get the machine quickly running and making delicious coffee in no time.\r\n\r\nWhen initially seeing the size of the box we were concerned that the machine was going to be massive and bulky. However on getting the machine out and setup it actually looked quite elegant. \r\n\r\nWhile setting up the machine we noticed that all the parts were easy to disassemble and almost all of it was dishwasher safe making it super easy to clean all the components. The parts that could not be put in the dishwasher could be easily cleaned with a microfiber cloth, a bit of soap and water if needed.\r\n\r\nDuring setup we did spill some water on the top metal shiny surface  while prepping for the first coffee and this did leave a watermark on the top. However this was easily cleaned  but we noted that the mirror- like surfaces would likely mark over time which we felt was a shame but unlikely to be something that could be fixed to and keep the elegant looks.\r\n\r\nWhile making coffee with the machine for the first time it\'s hard to tell what size settings to use S/M/L it would have been nice to have some details in the manuals about the default milliliters these would provide. \r\n\r\nThe milk containers look smart, with a dial on the top that allows you to adjust the amount of froth required for the drink you are making, with an adjustable height spout to ensure you get it at the right level for your cup. When filling this we did notice one potential problem with the design of the lid, it doesn\'t have any way to hold the lid to the container of milk. So if you were to pick it up by just the lid you would drop the container of milk. \r\n\r\nThere is a dial that allows you to finely adjust the grind of your beans to get the perfect grind every time. With a section to put pre ground beans if you wanted to, we decided to use this for decaf ground coffee and the machine comes with a cute little coffee bean scoop, bean stirrer and an ice tray for your ""cold drink"" options.\r\n\r\nOnce you have completed making a drink with the machine the milk canister has a clean setting on the dial.This pumps clean water through the milk container spouts cleaning them. While you could let this drip into the drip tray at the bottom we would recommend just putting a cup under and emptying this water. There is also a cleaning process when you turn the machine off which clears out the coffee spouts.\r\n\r\nA nice feature of the refillable water container is that the machine is able to tell when it is getting low and asks you to fill it back up again. After discovering this we also noticed that no such feature exists for the milk so if you were to run out of milk it doesnt stop and will just spray out steam. \r\n\r\nThe machine is capable of taking a wide array of different sized cups with a small door at the front that allows it to fit very tall cups and also travel mugs in the machine. We noted a big improvement over our old coffee machine as it allowed us to use some of the nice coffee cups that just did not fit on the old machine.\r\n\r\nWhile we did manage to get the app installed on our phone, we found the process unreliable and took a couple of attempts of us putting in the same information. Once we had this setup we were able to trigger a coffee and the app tried to track the progress but seemed to lag behind with the coffee being finished well before the app knew. This app also comes with a heap of custom recipes to make all sorts of hot, cold and alcoholic drinks with the machine. \r\n\r\nWhile the machine appears to go through a large amount of water, we believe this to be due to the number of times it purges water through the system to keep it clean and also to ensure you get a hot cup of coffee\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day we found the Eletta Explore by De Longhi bean to cup  to be a great way to have barista quality coffee in the comfort of your home with ease.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Been using this for a while now and I can honestly say it's been brilliant.\r\nWas initially a little concerned that it would be too large for my kitchen counter but it's surprisingly smaller than expected and fits into the corner perfectly. \r\nStraight out of the box it's super easy to unpack and set up.\r\nOn switching it on it gives you clear instructions on set up,just follow the prompts on the screen.\r\nThere are a whole host of options regarding coffee types and at first it's a little confusing, but after a bit of experimenting I've now settled on 4/5 favourite which are saved in the machines memory.\r\nNever been a fan of chilled coffee but this machine has opened a whole new world to me.\r\nI'm a fan,a big fan,especially now the weather has warmed up.\r\nIts lovely to have a feshly brewed ice cold coffee whilst sitting in the sunshine.\r\nCleaning is super easy,the machine gives you prompts as to when it needs doing and guides you through the process with clear guidance.\r\nEmptying the grounds tray is equally simple.\r\nTake the time to experiment with all the different settings and features and you will soon find a perfect coffee that suits.\r\nOverall I am super impressed with this machine and I'm sure over time I will only like it even more.\r\nWould highly recommend this to anyone that is considering it.\r\nA fantastic machine."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first ever coffee machine and boy have I been missing out this is such a great addition to my kitchen so easy to use makes great coffees any type you want strong medium light has so many selections of hot drinks also you can make cold drinks but I haven’t really used that option yet another great addition is wifi connection I’ve downloaded the app and I can use it to personalise my drinks I’ve not had any problems with this so far under a min I get a great cup of coffee and I love it east to use easy to set up easy to clean and amazing coffee at home', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Eletta Explore is the best coffee machine I have ever owned. You can choose from both hot and cold drinks, with the attachments provided for both. I personally love the fact you’re able to customise your coffee (or other hot or cold beverage) to your liking and save it - it’s so convenient!\r\n\r\nI’ve also used this for making frothy hot chocolates, it’s honestly incredibly versatile that you’re able to use it for such a wide range of drinks.\r\n\r\nThe coffee to go cup is also great! It’s sturdy and keeps drinks both hot and cold for a good while (although I always finish them before they’d get cold anyway!).\r\n\r\nI’d highly recommend the Eletta Explorer to anyone looking for a high and premium quality coffee machine!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This was a huge step up from our stove top espresso maker, but we are so pleased to have made the switch!

You can choose from so many different verities of coffees and you can adjust how much coffee/milk you would like in your cup, I love the fact you can use this machine for coffees on the go no more wasting money on take away coffees. I would recommend this product to anyone who is coffee mad like me.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Really happy with this coffee machine, it has a great range of options, which will take me a long time to get through! Hot or cold options, as well as customisable sizes, make it great for the a bigger household. You can also save a number of different peoples preferences for easy access to your favourites. The coffee tastes great and the milk frother ensures a cafe standard finish. The machine itself looks great and fits well in a smaller kitchen. It also has handy reminders for cleaning which make it really straight forward to use and maintain. I’m a big fan and would go as far to say it’s the best coffee machine I’ve used. Using the portable cup is also saving me from buying daily morning coffees on the way to work.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an amazing coffee machine that is well worth the money. It makes coffee shop quality coffee at home. Having some barista experience when using this machine was useful however it is very easy to use for anyone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The cold brew and cold foam features are definitely the standouts for me with this machine. I am very much an iced coffee man. Before this I was using an espresso machine, waiting for it to cool down over ice then trying to foam up some milk with a little electric whisk thing. Although it’s not truly ‘cold brew’ it drips out the coffee a bit at a time so it has that same smooth, less acidic taste which is fantastic. I’m used to just making a jug at a time in the fridge so having it on demand whenever I want it is great. And the cold foam is amazing! I’ll make a cold brew cappuccino for my walk to work and the foam is still sitting there 45 minutes later. \r\nThe saved drinks function is a nice idea but I think you need to be able to name the presets - for me it would be most useful for remembering which size is right for different sized cups and mugs. This isn’t an option so it was still a bit of a guessing game every time. Not the end of the world though, the cancel button is surprisingly efficient and pretty much instant if your cup is overflowing and if your cup isn’t full enough you can just add more coffee or milk or water on top no problem. \r\nI do find the milk carafes more annoying to clean (and I wish there were only one for storage sake) than the little milk jug with my previous espresso machine but the foam you can achieve is honestly much better and more consistent so it’s worth it. One thing I did find a bit annoying - with a machine like this I would expect it to tell me the exact measurement of milk to put in the carafe to make my chosen size of drink - but it’ll tell you to fill to level 5 then only use up to level 3 or 4? So now I have this tiny bit of milk leftover. Eventually we started just remembering how much to use but for a machine with this many bells and whistles I would expect it to just tell me accurately. \r\nThe WiFi feature didn’t really work - it kept disconnecting and it would take a hundred tries to get it back on so I stopped bothering eventually. I’m not a big coffee connoisseur so I didn’t really mind about the smart bean thing but if you’re really into coffee you might like it. \r\nThe enormous menu of drinks was perhaps unnecessary but still fun to scroll through and try something different occasionally. \r\nAppearance wise I don’t think it’s as attractive as a traditional espresso machine, but it’s actually pretty compact for all that it does. It is INSANELY heavy though so watch your back lifting it out of the box! \r\nOne other (very minor) thing I would love which is a bit of a shame isn’t a feature considering it does so much else is just a timer function. I quite like coming downstairs in the morning to a pot of fresh coffee waiting for me (and it does have a pot function) so it’s a shame this isn’t an option. Also be aware this model doesn’t come with the pot but it does come with the travel cup.  \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the machine has a lot of bells and whistles which might be appealing to someone who is super into coffee. But for your average every day cold brew/iced coffee lover, this machine is worth it just for how well it performs those functions. Love this machine and would recommend!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an amazing coffee machine.

Easy to change for each person.\r\nThe touch screen is really user friendly and has lots of options to choose from. You can change the temperature, strength, size and even has an option for extra coffee or milk too. \r\n\r\nCleaning wise this is really easy to do too. Once the beans are ground, we recycle our coffee in the garden, the machine lets you know when this needs doing. \r\nAlso a cleaning function after each coffee to ensure it tastes the best too.\r\n\r\nThe machine itself is heavy and a little big.

The on-screen instructions guide you through the process and remind you to empty the grounds container and drip tray, fill the water and bean hopper and to descale the machine. Even having a little red indicator showing when the drip tray is full is a nice touch. The range of drinks is great and I like that you can save your preferences to save time when you come to make a new drink. Having two carafes is a bit inconvenient because it feels like you have to wash them so frequently (though they're easy to dismantle and wash). However, the frothy milk it produces is great, for both hot and cold. And, whilst it's expensive and inconvenient to buy skimmed milk especially for the cold foam, I found the foam produced was almost as good when using semi-skimmed so I'd just stick to that. Overall, a great machine that makes great tasting coffee, and doesn't make you figure everything out yourself."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sleek, stylish, compact, convenient and really easy to use, maintain and clean.

It's so easy to set up and start using. \r\n\r\nCertain parts can be removed and easily washed so that's a bonus."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] And the answer is exceptional\r\n\r\nThis is my first expensive bean to cup machine so I wasn't sure what to expect or whether this would be worth the high price tag. \r\n\r\nFirst off this is a substantial machine, it wouldn't look out of place in a business. I was quite intimidated when I unpacked everything and that it would be complex to operate. In reality the on-screen guide literally talks you through every step in the set up and coffee making process. It really is idiot proof\r\n\r\nThe drink choices are perfect and can be fast tracked between hot and cold to save time scrolling the menu. You can set up your own profile and the customisation options seem endless, such as size of your own travel cup, grind off the coffee, level of milk froth. I've been using is it for a month now and still finding new features.\r\n\r\nOperation is as easy as pour beans in, plug in the milk carafe and pick your coffee! It also allows you to add pre-ground coffee too. It's really that effortless\r\n\r\nEverything is well made and sturdy. The coffee grounds get whisked away to a storage tank behind the drip tray and the water tank holds a substantial amount of fluid. Nothing feels flimsy, cheap and it dismantles easy for cleaning. \r\n\r\nMy only criticism is when the machine first turns on and off it purges water to clean itself. This deposits in the drip tray (a fairly large amount) I prefer this in a container instead as it's cleaner. For the money I'd have liked to have seen a tub provided for this reason. It's the same for the milk carafe cleaning cycle which fires out hot milky water. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would not hesitate to recommend this machine. Quite frankly it's an amazing piece of kit and the drinks it makes rival anything you get in a shop, minus a fancy milk pattern. However even this you can steam the milk and pour yourself, if you wished. \r\n\r\nWorth every penny and looks like it will last for years!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This machine is amazing with how much it can do! From the different types of hot coffees (latte, cappuccino, expresso, white coffee etc) to cold coffee or cold brew. The machine has automatic steam clean cycles to keep each cup of coffee full of flavour. Touch screen to scroll through and choose the coffee style you prefer, for example; bean strength, milk froth etc. Cold milk or cold coffee drinks are perfect for on the go or to enjoy during the summer! Bean adapt technology means the machine can change it's settings if needed for that great coffee taste. The machine can also connect to app on your phone to create your drink remotely without having to touch the machine. So easy to set up, use and clean! Also doesn't take up much room on the kitchen side. Great for guests coming round and feel like treating them with a gorgeous coffee of their choice and flavour."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got the delonghi eletta explore coffee machine, I love the fact it has hot and cold drink options, because my go too drink is a cold coffee. The machine is so easy to use, this is the first bean to cup machine I have ever used or owned and I do not regret having it. The machine blends the coffee beans perfectly, froths the milk beautifully and the coffee you get from this is just like a barrista coffee. If you love coffee this is the machine for you. Well done delonghi', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this Delonghi bean to cup coffee machine. It is a compact machine considering the amazing amount of features it offers. Fits easily in my smallish kitchen and looks really good with the glossy black and silver design and an easy to read screen. Quick to assemble and comes with a video link as well as a booklet so it was ready for use 10 minutes after opening the box. It offers hot and cold drinks and you can personalise all your favourites and the screen keeps you informed while the coffee is being made and reminds you to clean, put the milk in the fridge and to fill the water container. I am amazed at how quick and easy it is to make the best coffee I have ever tasted. From a frothy cappuccino to a milky latte this Eletta Explorer just makes incredibly good coffee. There is an option for cold drinks and hot drinks and you can pick a size option from an espresso to a large to go latte. You can choose the strength of the coffee and you can save your favourite combinations. The box contains a travel mug and I no longer buy a coffee every morning because I can make my own. It’s very easy to keep clean on the outside and everything is easy to clean on the inside - from the coffee ground tray to the milk jug; all can be pulled apart and washed. I am still working my way through all the drink options but I am so happy with the quantity of incredible machine and the coffee it makes. The difference between this machine and my previous pod coffee machine is that I now know what a really good cup of coffee tastes like! I really can’t recommend this DeLonghi coffee machine enough.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a brilliant machine for my coffee addiction.\r\nI love how I can programme each person profile to have their coffee how they like it. I like how I can make hot and cold coffee drinks. \r\nIt's bit of a bulky machine so not good if you have limited counter space. \r\nTravel mug fits in to make coffee for morning runs"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This has revolutionised my coffee intake and increased my coffee game to the max.

While I expected a semi decent coffee what I got was so good literally, I was amazed. Better than a major brand coffee shop ! My cafetiere is now retired and this is my machine for every single cup! I love it! Its brilliant! Once you've set it up all you need is to press the buttons, it's easier than the instructions make it out to be. Whole heartedly recommend!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well what can I say about this all singing, all dancing coffee machine!\r\n\r\nWell, for a start, you need to make sure you have enough worktop space, as it’s quite big! Luckily we have spare space, but if you didn’t, it’s quite heavy so ensure you don’t have to lift it to a place far away!!\r\n\r\n50 different ways to make coffee, and I’m only on about 9/10 so far, as it’s not warmed up enough for the cold stuff! \r\n\r\nThe grinder is a little noisy, but that’s about the only thing I can say bad about it. It is pretty expensive though, so you have to be sure you’re going to use it a lot to get the best use out of it!\r\n\r\nIf you’re an absolute coffee lover, this is for you! If you’re not, go for a cheaper, less complicated model.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This was an upgrade from a Delonghi Authentica and it’s honestly made such a difference being able to touch a button and have my coffee pour itself while I get ready for work. I like that it also has hot and cold options which is great for summer approaching. I use the take away flask everyday as it keeps hot drinks lovely and hot. Totally in love!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Only one word can describe this coffe machine - perfection. It is very easy to use, coffe taste amazing and coffe machine looks very stylish. I just love touch screen, it is realy amazing quality. I wiuld recommend to buy it.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I normally spend a fortune on coffee shops every month so I got this to try and use at home. We'll, I'm very glad I did it was amazing! So easy to use and so many different coffees to choose from but tastes amazing like it's come from a coffee shop. It's very stylish and modern and sits in the kitchen perfect. Definitely recommend if you're a coffee lover. Guests will love this also."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product is high quality, professional and worth the money. The options and customisation of coffee products is endless, we are especially pleased with the profiles option, allowing all family members to have their own preferences. I would say the app could be easier to use, we had a lot of connection issues early on but once we were set up it's been pretty straight forward. Having an at-home coffee system with fresh ground beans is a game changer for us all, we will likely save money by the end of the year by not drinking out as much! The fresh milk option is elite in comparison to other at home machines, and the choice of 2 easy to change units is great to alternate between cows milk and oat milk depending on who's using the machine. 9.9/10, love it."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is simply the best coffee machine I have ever had.  I have had pod machines but hands down this bean to cup machine wins!\r\n\r\nSo simple to set up and it looks the part too. Makes an amazing cup of coffee however you like it.  I have always wanted a machine that has a milk frother and you can control how frothy you want it and now I do- makes great hot chocolate for the kids if you just use the frothy milk.\r\n\r\nMy coffee is made really quick and easy I love a nice milky latte and this delivers with the press of the touchscreen, great features and the display gives guidance and tells you when to clean. Amazing.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an excellent coffee machine that I didn't know I needed in my life. I've been using this machine to make a bunch of different coffee types, the lattes in particular are fantastic. \r\nThe machine is so simple to use, just use the touch screen to swipe along, find the coffee you fancy, hot or cold, select it, dial in whether how intense you want it and what cup size and hit brew and then just watch and wait it prepares the perfect coffee. \r\nI love the fact you can use the coffee link app to help dial in the flavours of the coffee using the bean adapt feature, it's really helpful for maximising the taste. \r\nIt's not too loud while pouring but can get a little loud when grinding the beans, but that's to be expected. The machine is really good at letting you know if there's an issue, whether the water tank needs filling, the coffee beans are low or if it's having trouble extracting the coffee due to the grind size. It's never been so simple to get delicious tasting coffee."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely adore this coffee machine, easy to det up and looks really professional in your kitchen makes a perfect cup of coffee.

Except for this the Rivelia is an absolute marvel of a machine!! \n\nA superb barista style coffee experience at home. It has me addicted.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently received the Delonghi Rivelia Coffee Machine in black complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This machine offers a range of impressive features that have enhanced my daily coffee experience.\n\nFirstly, the inclusion of a carafe for milk is a game-changer. It allows me to effortlessly create creamy lattes and cappuccinos with ease. The ability to switch between two interchangeable hoppers to cater to my favorite coffees adds a level of convenience and versatility that I truly appreciate. \n\nThe touch-colored display is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. With 16 different drink options to choose from, I can easily find my desired beverage. What truly amazed me is the option to adjust the strength and amount of coffee in each drink. This customization feature ensures that every cup is tailored to my taste preference.\n\nThe inclusion of 4 user profiles takes personalization to a whole new level. Each member of my household can now personalize their drinks according to their liking, making mornings more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nOne minor drawback I noticed is that the rich foam is only achieved with non-plant based milk. Though this is a small issue, it would have been nice if the foam could be produced with plant-based milk options as well.\n\nDesign-wise, the compact size and soft angles of the machine make it an attractive addition to my kitchen countertop. However, I would have preferred slightly larger hoppers and a larger water tank for added convenience. Additionally, a longer tray would have been ideal to accommodate larger cups.\n\nCleaning the machine is a breeze, thanks to its user-friendly design. I particularly appreciate the little compartment at the top of the machine, where the extra accessories are neatly stored. This keeps everything organized and easily accessible.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love the Delonghi Rivelia Coffee Machine. Its ability to create delicious and personalized coffees is truly exceptional. Despite a few minor preferences for larger hoppers, water tank, and tray, the machine's overall performance and convenience have left me thoroughly satisfied. I highly recommend it to all coffee enthusiasts looking for a stylish and feature-rich coffee machine."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When turned on, the display attracts attention. I usually don't get excited about colorful screens in household appliances, but I admit that coffee machines are an exception. I love watching visualizations of different coffees :). In this case, we have 16 ready-made programs to choose from on the display. Additionally, you can change the standard settings to your own. We can set up to 4 profiles (e.g. for 4 family members). Within each of the 4 profiles, we can set our own settings for each of the 16 types of coffee drinks! Milk coffee lovers (that's me!) can choose a large morning latte machiatto, a small afternoon cappuccino and hot frothed milk in an amount equal to children's cups.\n\n\nThe touch screen works perfectly. My husband can be considered an expert because his fingers are damaged from DIY work, usually don't get along with touch buttons on household appliances but here is working everything perfectly.\n\nFresh grinding, filtered water, high pressure and the right brewing temperature - the De'Longhi coffee machine has everything necessary to prepare tasty coffee.\n\n* For those who like to use ready-made solutions and those who prefer to tailor every detail to their needs.\n* For milk coffee lovers\n* For those who optimize space on the kitchen counter, although the coffee machine is one of the most important pieces of equipment on it.\n* For lovers of modern and aesthetic solutions\n* For a family and a single person, it will also work well in a small office.\n\nI really love this coffee machine.

It is as good as any you would buy in the coffee shops. It also sweet enough to came with two pack of coffee beans. \n\nThe only thing that not that good is the drinks could be hotter.

The step by step process guides you with pictures and text that is clear on what you need to do to prepare a fresh cup of coffee. \n\nThe only downside to this super coffee machine is the cost of buying coffee bean’s compared to coffee pods/granules.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very fortunate to be gifted this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I wasn't too much of a coffee drinker before but my husband loves a latte most of all so he was very pleased with this, and now I'm a convert too 😂 \nMaking a drink itself is really simple and actually is the touch of a button. I love that you can customise how strong you want your coffee and with a large collection of mugs of different sizes it's easy to change size. The profiles make it really easy too- I have one set up for me, husband and a guest profile so visitors can't mess up our preferences.\nMy kid loves his hot milks now too, and I make great hot chocolate using a little hot water and hot milk. Lovely and creamy. Talking of milk, the frother is really good, makes it really professional, and is super simple to clean. Haven't given the full machine a proper clean yet so can't comment on that but it looks easy enough.\n\nCons: Not many, your milk bill will go up and when people catch wind they can get a good coffee at your house rather than a cafe you'll suddenly have a revolving door of guests just popping in. Only thing I feel could be improved is if you're a house that has people drinking milky coffee and teas it's a bit of a faff taking the water spout out and swapping it for the milk carafe (we put the kettle away). Would also be nice if it came with a matching cup or something to keep under it as it spits water out the clean and heat up every time.\n\nOther pros: Compact and stylish, hasn't increased my electric bill at all and I thought it would."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was extremely lucky to receive this coffee machine for free from Influenster and Delonghi for my honest review. I've been using the Rivelia coffee machine for the last two weeks and I am honestly blown away with how amazing this machine really is. It's really easy to make barista quality coffees at the touch of a button (or should I say screen) and the taste of the coffees from the machine would rival any coffee shop I've ever visited. It was really easy to setup and the touchscreen on top of the machine guides you step by step throught the setting up process, which I found more useful then reading the manual (which does also come in the box). I love the fact that you can choose from one of the preset coffees (such as caffelatte, latte machiatto, flat white etc) or customise any of these to your preference and you can save this so the machine will remeber your preference for the next time you select the same coffee. You can also save different profiles, so other people in your household can customise any of the preset coffees to their specific liking (which is handy for me and my partner as we like our coffees at different strengths). The machine comes with two interchangeable bean hoppers which is great if you want to try different types of beans, you don't have to wait until you've used your current beans, you can just switch the hoppers and away you go. I also like the fact that when the machine has finished making the coffee it tells you via the touch screen on the top for you to clean the milk dispenser (you turn the dial to the clean setting on top of the milk dispenser) and the machine also runs water through the coffee dispenser when turning it off. The machine also tells you when it's time to empty the coffee grounds too, which is handy.  I know this machine is quite pricey but from the build and quality this will last for a long time to come. If you're a coffee lover that wants barista coffees within the comfort of your own home which you can customise to your own liking, the Delonghi Rivelia is for you and I would highly recommend this machine."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Proper coffee taste.

The touch screen display displays the instructions, and it doesn't let you proceed until each portion has been finished.  \n\nYou can begin crafting the beverages after creating a profile. There are so many options available. The machine will also remember how you like drinks and save them to your profile. \n\nExpect nothing less than drinks of barista calibre. Changing to stronger or decaf beans couldn't be simpler; just remove the canisters from the machine's top. There's also no need to worry about contamination because the machine will clean itself before utilising new beans and it comes with some tools for any leftover residue. \n\nBoth my family and I have had a great time utilising the machine. For my daughter, we prepare the creamiest, tastiest hot chocolates using the hot milk option. \n\nWe simply remove the milk container whenever we are done and put the remaining milk in the refrigerator.

This machine offers a range of impressive features that have enhanced my daily coffee experience.\n\nFirstly, the inclusion of a carafe for milk is a game-changer. It allows me to effortlessly create creamy lattes and cappuccinos with ease. The ability to switch between two interchangeable hoppers to cater to my favorite coffees adds a level of convenience and versatility that I truly appreciate. \n\nThe touch-colored display is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. With 16 different drink options to choose from, I can easily find my desired beverage. What truly amazed me is the option to adjust the strength and amount of coffee in each drink. This customization feature ensures that every cup is tailored to my taste preference.\n\nThe inclusion of 4 user profiles takes personalization to a whole new level. Each member of my household can now personalize their drinks according to their liking, making mornings more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nOne minor drawback I noticed is that the rich foam is only achieved with non-plant based milk. Though this is a small issue, it would have been nice if the foam could be produced with plant-based milk options as well.\n\nDesign-wise, the compact size and soft angles of the machine make it an attractive addition to my kitchen countertop. However, I would have preferred slightly larger hoppers and a larger water tank for added convenience. Additionally, a longer tray would have been ideal to accommodate larger cups.\n\nCleaning the machine is a breeze, thanks to its user-friendly design. I particularly appreciate the little compartment at the top of the machine, where the extra accessories are neatly stored. This keeps everything organized and easily accessible.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love the Delonghi Rivelia Coffee Machine. Its ability to create delicious and personalized coffees is truly exceptional. Despite a few minor preferences for larger hoppers, water tank, and tray, the machine's overall performance and convenience have left me thoroughly satisfied. I highly recommend it to all coffee enthusiasts looking for a stylish and feature-rich coffee machine."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When turned on, the display attracts attention.

Within each of the 4 profiles, we can set our own settings for each of the 16 types of coffee drinks! Milk coffee lovers (that's me!) can choose a large morning latte machiatto, a small afternoon cappuccino and hot frothed milk in an amount equal to children's cups.\n\n\nThe touch screen works perfectly. My husband can be considered an expert because his fingers are damaged from DIY work, usually don't get along with touch buttons on household appliances but here is working everything perfectly.\n\nFresh grinding, filtered water, high pressure and the right brewing temperature - the De'Longhi coffee machine has everything necessary to prepare tasty coffee.\n\n* For those who like to use ready-made solutions and those who prefer to tailor every detail to their needs.\n* For milk coffee lovers\n* For those who optimize space on the kitchen counter, although the coffee machine is one of the most important pieces of equipment on it.\n* For lovers of modern and aesthetic solutions\n* For a family and a single person, it will also work well in a small office.\n\nI really love this coffee machine. It has everything I need: it is hassle-free and allows me to perfectly match the coffee to my own preferences. In my opinion, this is a high-end device. For me, it is not only functional, but also a very elegant and modern coffee machine."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good clear selection in text display.\nEasy to follow instructions and a good range of different types of coffee choices. Easy of use and the ability to customised your coffee exactly how you want it or use the preset options. Only 1 minute your customised coffee will be ready. It is as good as any you would buy in the coffee shops. It also sweet enough to came with two pack of coffee beans. \n\nThe only thing that not that good is the drinks could be hotter. The temperature of the coffee is just fine to drink, but it cool down quite fast especially in the cold day. Other than that, nothing more to complain! It’s a great automatic bean to cup coffee machine. I would definitely recommend to all of you.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was kindly gifted this amazing state of the art coffee machine from Influenster and Delonghi. \n\nI’d go as far as saying that this is possibly the most advanced coffee machine I have ever used! The touch screen feature is amazing and it’s insane that I can now get barista style coffee in the comfort of my own home! \n\nMornings have been made simpler and my bill for coffee chains has gone down since using this! I get to choose all the particles that make up my coffee. \n\nThis will be a staple in our house for many years to come', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having this coffee machine in our house, is like living in our own coffee shop! We use this more than our kettle now, and my partner uses it more than me. Waking up in the morning and being able to press a few buttons to make a delicious drink is just perfect - I’m so pleased I was chosen to try out this product!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the most advanced coffee machine out there that I have ever tried!!!\nEvery morning I love waking up, super excited at what I am going to drink using this amazing automatic bean to cup coffee machine. \nFirst of all excellent smooth quality of material and parts of the machine. Strong bold colour and weight of the Delonghi coffee machine which now sits permanently where my kettle and coffee granules used to be. \nThis relies on the most advanced technology yet to prepare 16 different types of coffee:\nFrom Espresso to Latte Macchiato, from Americano to Flat White, with a delicious milk foam automatically frothed by LatteCrema Hot. You can substitute the milk with alternative ones eg: Oat, Soy, Almond or Coconut Milk\nWhen brewing the coffee you are able to adapt the setting by adding an Extra shot, adapt the size of drink & intensity of the drink. This personalisation can be saved to easily make your favourite drink without changing the settings over and over again.\nVery user friendly to use, even if you are not technical. The step by step process guides you with pictures and text that is clear on what you need to do to prepare a fresh cup of coffee. \n\nThe only downside to this super coffee machine is the cost of buying coffee bean’s compared to coffee pods/granules.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very fortunate to be gifted this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I wasn't too much of a coffee drinker before but my husband loves a latte most of all so he was very pleased with this, and now I'm a convert too 😂 \nMaking a drink itself is really simple and actually is the touch of a button. I love that you can customise how strong you want your coffee and with a large collection of mugs of different sizes it's easy to change size. The profiles make it really easy too- I have one set up for me, husband and a guest profile so visitors can't mess up our preferences.\nMy kid loves his hot milks now too, and I make great hot chocolate using a little hot water and hot milk. Lovely and creamy. Talking of milk, the frother is really good, makes it really professional, and is super simple to clean. Haven't given the full machine a proper clean yet so can't comment on that but it looks easy enough.\n\nCons: Not many, your milk bill will go up and when people catch wind they can get a good coffee at your house rather than a cafe you'll suddenly have a revolving door of guests just popping in. Only thing I feel could be improved is if you're a house that has people drinking milky coffee and teas it's a bit of a faff taking the water spout out and swapping it for the milk carafe (we put the kettle away). Would also be nice if it came with a matching cup or something to keep under it as it spits water out the clean and heat up every time.\n\nOther pros: Compact and stylish, hasn't increased my electric bill at all and I thought it would."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was extremely lucky to receive this coffee machine for free from Influenster and Delonghi for my honest review. I've been using the Rivelia coffee machine for the last two weeks and I am honestly blown away with how amazing this machine really is. It's really easy to make barista quality coffees at the touch of a button (or should I say screen) and the taste of the coffees from the machine would rival any coffee shop I've ever visited. It was really easy to setup and the touchscreen on top of the machine guides you step by step throught the setting up process, which I found more useful then reading the manual (which does also come in the box). I love the fact that you can choose from one of the preset coffees (such as caffelatte, latte machiatto, flat white etc) or customise any of these to your preference and you can save this so the machine will remeber your preference for the next time you select the same coffee. You can also save different profiles, so other people in your household can customise any of the preset coffees to their specific liking (which is handy for me and my partner as we like our coffees at different strengths). The machine comes with two interchangeable bean hoppers which is great if you want to try different types of beans, you don't have to wait until you've used your current beans, you can just switch the hoppers and away you go. I also like the fact that when the machine has finished making the coffee it tells you via the touch screen on the top for you to clean the milk dispenser (you turn the dial to the clean setting on top of the milk dispenser) and the machine also runs water through the coffee dispenser when turning it off. The machine also tells you when it's time to empty the coffee grounds too, which is handy.  I know this machine is quite pricey but from the build and quality this will last for a long time to come. If you're a coffee lover that wants barista coffees within the comfort of your own home which you can customise to your own liking, the Delonghi Rivelia is for you and I would highly recommend this machine."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Proper coffee taste. Easy to ensemble and use. You can select different profiles to customise individual tastes and strengths. The taste? Brilliant. My husband is Italian and he is finally happy to have found a coffee machine to use at home that prepares his espressos 'come al bar' . It has a milk frother that even that can be customised as per everyone's individual taste.\nFinally no more bickering about coffee taste or strength 😂.\nYes, it is a bit expensive but definitely is worth every penny."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Took a while to get to me but I was like a kid at Christmas when it arrived. Very easy to set up and get going. Simple to operate and its the talk of the house when people come to visit.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love this coffee machine!! The best on the market, the way you can change from different coffees is amazing. Do you like decaf no problem just swap the cups. Milk frothing is so good as you can change the setting on how much you want your milk frothed. The touch screen is great addition and makes things so easy and cool also! Bean adapt technology lets you set different temperature and grind depending on coffee beans. The design is modern and very smart. Delonghi is the best brand for coffee machines. It’s well worth the money and like a coffee shop at home', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow, I'm blown away by how cutting-edge this coffee machine is. It truly takes care of everything, even self-cleaning after usage.  \n\nThe machine required only a minimal amount of setup. The touch screen display displays the instructions, and it doesn't let you proceed until each portion has been finished.  \n\nYou can begin crafting the beverages after creating a profile. There are so many options available. The machine will also remember how you like drinks and save them to your profile. \n\nExpect nothing less than drinks of barista calibre. Changing to stronger or decaf beans couldn't be simpler; just remove the canisters from the machine's top. There's also no need to worry about contamination because the machine will clean itself before utilising new beans and it comes with some tools for any leftover residue. \n\nBoth my family and I have had a great time utilising the machine. For my daughter, we prepare the creamiest, tastiest hot chocolates using the hot milk option. \n\nWe simply remove the milk container whenever we are done and put the remaining milk in the refrigerator. If needed just immerse the milk chamber in warm, soapy water for around 30 minutes to clean it.  \n\nTherefore, if you're seeking for a really remarkable product, look no further. This is the ultimate dream come true for coffee and tech enthusiasts."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This coffee machine is perfect. From the coffee quality, how it looks, to how easy it is to clean. \nThe coffee options given on the screen are great and lots of them. We haven't really used the profile option because we both drink the same in our house, but if we didn't then that would be a useful feature. \nThe coffees are top notch, like straight out of a coffee shop, even with options of how froth you want your milk and easy in-and-out bean hoppers to easily change your coffee. Doesn't take any time to set up and takes less than a minute to make a coffee. \nCleaning the machine is simple - the on-screen menu helps so much with this and gives you recommendations for cleaning and shows you exactly what to do to make it super easy.\nLast but not least, I am impressed with the way it looks. Its not too big that it takes up our whole counter space, but it also looks beautiful. We are a very happy coffee drinking house having been given the Rivelia to try and review!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Really good and easy to use.

I cannot get over the range of drinks it can make and best of all you can set up user profiles that are colour coded and remember your favourite order settings! Every detail on this machine is so well thought out from the ease of use to its shape - this machine has the smoothest water tank. I love how it’s cleans itself at the start and end of each use and also guides you through deep cleaning the milk container. Speaking of milk, I’m always a little dubious of this style of frother but I needn’t of feared - it said to get best result use fridge temperature milk and it did not disappoint, you can even pop it in the fridge to reduce wastage. I cannot stress how amazing this machine is - it is definitely a great investment piece (a god send for those of us who work from home!)', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recived the De'Longhi Rivelia Bean to Cup Coffee Machine complimentary from Influenster and DeLonghi im exchange for my honest review, and it has truly exceeded my expectations. \nOne of the standout features of this machine is its 16 pre-programmed coffee options.

This machine offers a range of impressive features that have enhanced my daily coffee experience.\n\nFirstly, the inclusion of a carafe for milk is a game-changer. It allows me to effortlessly create creamy lattes and cappuccinos with ease. The ability to switch between two interchangeable hoppers to cater to my favorite coffees adds a level of convenience and versatility that I truly appreciate. \n\nThe touch-colored display is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. With 16 different drink options to choose from, I can easily find my desired beverage. What truly amazed me is the option to adjust the strength and amount of coffee in each drink. This customization feature ensures that every cup is tailored to my taste preference.\n\nThe inclusion of 4 user profiles takes personalization to a whole new level. Each member of my household can now personalize their drinks according to their liking, making mornings more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nOne minor drawback I noticed is that the rich foam is only achieved with non-plant based milk. Though this is a small issue, it would have been nice if the foam could be produced with plant-based milk options as well.\n\nDesign-wise, the compact size and soft angles of the machine make it an attractive addition to my kitchen countertop. However, I would have preferred slightly larger hoppers and a larger water tank for added convenience. Additionally, a longer tray would have been ideal to accommodate larger cups.\n\nCleaning the machine is a breeze, thanks to its user-friendly design. I particularly appreciate the little compartment at the top of the machine, where the extra accessories are neatly stored. This keeps everything organized and easily accessible.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love the Delonghi Rivelia Coffee Machine. Its ability to create delicious and personalized coffees is truly exceptional.

Within each of the 4 profiles, we can set our own settings for each of the 16 types of coffee drinks! Milk coffee lovers (that's me!) can choose a large morning latte machiatto, a small afternoon cappuccino and hot frothed milk in an amount equal to children's cups.\n\n\nThe touch screen works perfectly. My husband can be considered an expert because his fingers are damaged from DIY work, usually don't get along with touch buttons on household appliances but here is working everything perfectly.\n\nFresh grinding, filtered water, high pressure and the right brewing temperature - the De'Longhi coffee machine has everything necessary to prepare tasty coffee.\n\n* For those who like to use ready-made solutions and those who prefer to tailor every detail to their needs.\n* For milk coffee lovers\n* For those who optimize space on the kitchen counter, although the coffee machine is one of the most important pieces of equipment on it.\n* For lovers of modern and aesthetic solutions\n* For a family and a single person, it will also work well in a small office.\n\nI really love this coffee machine. It has everything I need: it is hassle-free and allows me to perfectly match the coffee to my own preferences. In my opinion, this is a high-end device. For me, it is not only functional, but also a very elegant and modern coffee machine."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good clear selection in text display.\nEasy to follow instructions and a good range of different types of coffee choices. Easy of use and the ability to customised your coffee exactly how you want it or use the preset options. Only 1 minute your customised coffee will be ready. It is as good as any you would buy in the coffee shops. It also sweet enough to came with two pack of coffee beans. \n\nThe only thing that not that good is the drinks could be hotter. The temperature of the coffee is just fine to drink, but it cool down quite fast especially in the cold day. Other than that, nothing more to complain! It’s a great automatic bean to cup coffee machine. I would definitely recommend to all of you.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was kindly gifted this amazing state of the art coffee machine from Influenster and Delonghi. \n\nI’d go as far as saying that this is possibly the most advanced coffee machine I have ever used! The touch screen feature is amazing and it’s insane that I can now get barista style coffee in the comfort of my own home! \n\nMornings have been made simpler and my bill for coffee chains has gone down since using this! I get to choose all the particles that make up my coffee. \n\nThis will be a staple in our house for many years to come', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having this coffee machine in our house, is like living in our own coffee shop! We use this more than our kettle now, and my partner uses it more than me. Waking up in the morning and being able to press a few buttons to make a delicious drink is just perfect - I’m so pleased I was chosen to try out this product!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the most advanced coffee machine out there that I have ever tried!!!\nEvery morning I love waking up, super excited at what I am going to drink using this amazing automatic bean to cup coffee machine. \nFirst of all excellent smooth quality of material and parts of the machine. Strong bold colour and weight of the Delonghi coffee machine which now sits permanently where my kettle and coffee granules used to be. \nThis relies on the most advanced technology yet to prepare 16 different types of coffee:\nFrom Espresso to Latte Macchiato, from Americano to Flat White, with a delicious milk foam automatically frothed by LatteCrema Hot. You can substitute the milk with alternative ones eg: Oat, Soy, Almond or Coconut Milk\nWhen brewing the coffee you are able to adapt the setting by adding an Extra shot, adapt the size of drink & intensity of the drink. This personalisation can be saved to easily make your favourite drink without changing the settings over and over again.\nVery user friendly to use, even if you are not technical. The step by step process guides you with pictures and text that is clear on what you need to do to prepare a fresh cup of coffee. \n\nThe only downside to this super coffee machine is the cost of buying coffee bean’s compared to coffee pods/granules.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very fortunate to be gifted this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I wasn't too much of a coffee drinker before but my husband loves a latte most of all so he was very pleased with this, and now I'm a convert too 😂 \nMaking a drink itself is really simple and actually is the touch of a button. I love that you can customise how strong you want your coffee and with a large collection of mugs of different sizes it's easy to change size. The profiles make it really easy too- I have one set up for me, husband and a guest profile so visitors can't mess up our preferences.\nMy kid loves his hot milks now too, and I make great hot chocolate using a little hot water and hot milk. Lovely and creamy. Talking of milk, the frother is really good, makes it really professional, and is super simple to clean. Haven't given the full machine a proper clean yet so can't comment on that but it looks easy enough.\n\nCons: Not many, your milk bill will go up and when people catch wind they can get a good coffee at your house rather than a cafe you'll suddenly have a revolving door of guests just popping in. Only thing I feel could be improved is if you're a house that has people drinking milky coffee and teas it's a bit of a faff taking the water spout out and swapping it for the milk carafe (we put the kettle away). Would also be nice if it came with a matching cup or something to keep under it as it spits water out the clean and heat up every time.\n\nOther pros: Compact and stylish, hasn't increased my electric bill at all and I thought it would."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was extremely lucky to receive this coffee machine for free from Influenster and Delonghi for my honest review. I've been using the Rivelia coffee machine for the last two weeks and I am honestly blown away with how amazing this machine really is. It's really easy to make barista quality coffees at the touch of a button (or should I say screen) and the taste of the coffees from the machine would rival any coffee shop I've ever visited. It was really easy to setup and the touchscreen on top of the machine guides you step by step throught the setting up process, which I found more useful then reading the manual (which does also come in the box). I love the fact that you can choose from one of the preset coffees (such as caffelatte, latte machiatto, flat white etc) or customise any of these to your preference and you can save this so the machine will remeber your preference for the next time you select the same coffee. You can also save different profiles, so other people in your household can customise any of the preset coffees to their specific liking (which is handy for me and my partner as we like our coffees at different strengths). The machine comes with two interchangeable bean hoppers which is great if you want to try different types of beans, you don't have to wait until you've used your current beans, you can just switch the hoppers and away you go. I also like the fact that when the machine has finished making the coffee it tells you via the touch screen on the top for you to clean the milk dispenser (you turn the dial to the clean setting on top of the milk dispenser) and the machine also runs water through the coffee dispenser when turning it off. The machine also tells you when it's time to empty the coffee grounds too, which is handy.  I know this machine is quite pricey but from the build and quality this will last for a long time to come. If you're a coffee lover that wants barista coffees within the comfort of your own home which you can customise to your own liking, the Delonghi Rivelia is for you and I would highly recommend this machine."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Proper coffee taste. Easy to ensemble and use. You can select different profiles to customise individual tastes and strengths. The taste? Brilliant. My husband is Italian and he is finally happy to have found a coffee machine to use at home that prepares his espressos 'come al bar' . It has a milk frother that even that can be customised as per everyone's individual taste.\nFinally no more bickering about coffee taste or strength 😂.\nYes, it is a bit expensive but definitely is worth every penny."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Took a while to get to me but I was like a kid at Christmas when it arrived. Very easy to set up and get going. Simple to operate and its the talk of the house when people come to visit.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love this coffee machine!! The best on the market, the way you can change from different coffees is amazing. Do you like decaf no problem just swap the cups. Milk frothing is so good as you can change the setting on how much you want your milk frothed. The touch screen is great addition and makes things so easy and cool also! Bean adapt technology lets you set different temperature and grind depending on coffee beans. The design is modern and very smart. Delonghi is the best brand for coffee machines. It’s well worth the money and like a coffee shop at home', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow, I'm blown away by how cutting-edge this coffee machine is. It truly takes care of everything, even self-cleaning after usage.  \n\nThe machine required only a minimal amount of setup. The touch screen display displays the instructions, and it doesn't let you proceed until each portion has been finished.  \n\nYou can begin crafting the beverages after creating a profile. There are so many options available. The machine will also remember how you like drinks and save them to your profile. \n\nExpect nothing less than drinks of barista calibre. Changing to stronger or decaf beans couldn't be simpler; just remove the canisters from the machine's top. There's also no need to worry about contamination because the machine will clean itself before utilising new beans and it comes with some tools for any leftover residue. \n\nBoth my family and I have had a great time utilising the machine. For my daughter, we prepare the creamiest, tastiest hot chocolates using the hot milk option. \n\nWe simply remove the milk container whenever we are done and put the remaining milk in the refrigerator. If needed just immerse the milk chamber in warm, soapy water for around 30 minutes to clean it.  \n\nTherefore, if you're seeking for a really remarkable product, look no further. This is the ultimate dream come true for coffee and tech enthusiasts."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This coffee machine is perfect. From the coffee quality, how it looks, to how easy it is to clean. \nThe coffee options given on the screen are great and lots of them. We haven't really used the profile option because we both drink the same in our house, but if we didn't then that would be a useful feature. \nThe coffees are top notch, like straight out of a coffee shop, even with options of how froth you want your milk and easy in-and-out bean hoppers to easily change your coffee. Doesn't take any time to set up and takes less than a minute to make a coffee. \nCleaning the machine is simple - the on-screen menu helps so much with this and gives you recommendations for cleaning and shows you exactly what to do to make it super easy.\nLast but not least, I am impressed with the way it looks. Its not too big that it takes up our whole counter space, but it also looks beautiful. We are a very happy coffee drinking house having been given the Rivelia to try and review!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Really good and easy to use. Everyone loves using it . Love the size of it and the colour of it to . You can’t go wrong lol. You can get some much more out of it .', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve never wanted to gush about a product more than this. I am blown away at how good this is. From the moment you open the box everything is clear and the simple thing is all you have to do is turn it on and follow the prompts on the screen to set up - it’s that easy. I cannot get over the range of drinks it can make and best of all you can set up user profiles that are colour coded and remember your favourite order settings! Every detail on this machine is so well thought out from the ease of use to its shape - this machine has the smoothest water tank. I love how it’s cleans itself at the start and end of each use and also guides you through deep cleaning the milk container. Speaking of milk, I’m always a little dubious of this style of frother but I needn’t of feared - it said to get best result use fridge temperature milk and it did not disappoint, you can even pop it in the fridge to reduce wastage. I cannot stress how amazing this machine is - it is definitely a great investment piece (a god send for those of us who work from home!)', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recived the De'Longhi Rivelia Bean to Cup Coffee Machine complimentary from Influenster and DeLonghi im exchange for my honest review, and it has truly exceeded my expectations. \nOne of the standout features of this machine is its 16 pre-programmed coffee options. With just a simple touch of a button, you can enjoy a variety of coffee styles, including latte, espresso, flat white, and more. This wide selection ensures that you can always find the perfect cup of coffee to suit your mood and preferences.\n\nI love the ability to create and save personal coffee profiles. This means that you can customize your coffee just the way you like it, and the machine will remember your preferences for future brews. It's a fantastic feature for those who have specific tastes in coffee.\n\nThe inclusion of two bean hoppers is another practical feature.
