It does not, especially near the new push button that now releases the lid.  Also the lid had a life of its own.  It would pop open of its own accord every 5 to 10 minutes or so.

It's a bonnie wee thing, if ye ask me. Now, it might no' be the most excitin' topic oot there, but every kitchen needs a trusty bin, aye?\r\n\r\nFirst o' all, let me start wi' the color. The grey hue o' this bin is as dreich as a rainy day in Edinburgh, but in a good way. It blends in nicely wi' ma kitchen decor, nae stickin' oot like a sair thumb. The size o' the bin is also a grand advantage. At 45 liters, it can gobble up quite a bit o' rubbish afore needin' emptied. That means less frequent trips tae the big bin ootside, savin' me time and effort.\r\n\r\nThe design o' this bin is sleek and functional, just like a fine scotch whisky. It's shaped like a bullet, which might seem odd at first, but it's actually quite clever. The slim profile fits nicely against the wall, takin' up minimal space in ma wee kitchen. The lid opens smoothly and closes wi' a satisfying thud, keepin' any unpleasant smells locked inside.\r\n\r\nAnither thing I appreciate aboot this bin is the durability. It's made o' sturdy materials that can withstand a fair bit o' bashing and clangin'. The plastic liner on the inside is a bonnie addition too, makin' it easy tae keep the bin clean and tidy.\r\n\r\nNow, I must admit, the price o' this bin is a wee bit steep. But ye ken, sometimes ye need tae invest in quality, especially when it comes tae somethin' ye use every day in yer kitchen. It's a solid investment that'll serve ye well for years tae come.\r\n\r\nSo, if ye're in need o' a trusty bin for yer kitchen, this 45 liter grey bullet bin might just be the ticket. It's practical, durable, and fits in nicely wi' ma Scottish sensibilities. Go on, give it a wee try and ye won't be disappointed."", 'No frills simple to use bin.', 'Excellent waste 100% satisfied lots of space easy to empty', ""I bought this for my motorhome as it's lightweight and easy to use and it certainly lives up to its spec.

The plastic hinge at the back had disintegrated.  I like to repair things when I can, but the lid was battered anyway as it used to hit the underside of our sink, and the hinge was in lots of pieces, beyond gluing back together.  So, settled on this similar looking replacement, not expecting much other than a straight swap, while the old one was retired to the garage as a simple no-lid bin.  Well, for starters, the new one is really shiny.  Polished stainless steel, it looks very nice, better than the brushed effect on the old one.  No dents on the lid either, but that was expected.  The surprises came when we used it.  It has a gentle open of the lid when you stand on the pedal, rather than springing open like Arkwright's till, so doesn't bang on the underside of the sink like the old one, no dents so far!  Then when you step off the pedal, it has a plunger thing at the back which makes the lid close slowly instead of biting your hand off if you're not quick enough.

As a rule, emptying each bin and replacing liners is now a noticeably more time-consuming task - and not  because there are now 3 and not 2.  General cleaning seems much the same effort.

When I came across this one I was really happy because it looks exactly the same as the one from dunelm. Unfortunately though this bin is a lot lighter than it looks in the pictures.

Secondly, the rolled lip around the bin is on the inside; so every time I take the liner out, something invariably catches on the lip and rips the liner open. Another star off.

I can use the 50 litre bin bags from Costco and easily hide the edges from showing. Otherwise it would be £30 for 50 Simple Human bin bags.

Totally get the hype', 'You get what you pay for …\r\nExcellent quality and so attractive 5*', ""I never thought I could love a bin, but I love this bin. It looks good, the foot lever mechanism is super smooth and completely silent, it holds a lot of rubbish and recycling, and the height is great (you don't have to lean over to drop items in the bins). The removable recycling bin insert is great too. It's got a folding handle so you can remove it from the main bin to carry it outside.\r\n\r\nThe bin comes with with a few custom-fit bin liners to try. I can confirm the bin liners (model H) fit like a glove and stay completely hidden from view when the bin is closed. If you use generic bin liners then they will be visible when you fold them over the rim to make them stay on. Please note you must buy simplehuman brand model H bin liners! I bought Barbantia model H by mistake and those are too big.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why this bin is so expensive, but you get what you pay for. If you buy a cheaper bin then the foot lever is guaranteed to break. This bin has a 10 year warranty so it better last! \r\n\r\nThe bin is great"", 'Was sceptical at the price but it’s worth it!!

It looks sleek and fits right into the kitchen vibe. Having two compartments (one for trash and one for recycling) makes life so much easier. The pedal works super smoothly, and the soft-close lid means no more loud bangs. It feels solid and well-made, so you know it's going to last. Overall, it’s a super practical and stylish bin that helps keep things tidy without any hassle."", 'Honestly didn’t think I could review a bin so highly but I’d genuinely recommend this one to anyone!\n\nIt looks really stylish and would fit well into most modern kitchens, especially as it feels slimline without losing out on too much capacity.\n\nBeing able to take the recycling bin out is a huge plus and the custom-fit liners are fantastic quality and reduce the ugly plastic overhang of standard liners!\n\nThe bin opens really smoothly and soft closes with no issues so far.\n\nThe built-in air freshener is a great touch and really does make a difference to the smell.\n\nIt’s an investment for sure, but one that I think is well worth it!', 'As a mum of two, the simplehuman 58 Litre Dual Compartment Recycling Bin in Grey has been a game-changer in our household. With kids running around and constant messes, I needed a bin that was not only practical but meets the needs of our family. The dual compartments make segregating waste and recycling incredibly straightforward—so much so that even my children can do it without any fuss. This can be easily lifted out. \n\nOne feature I particularly love is how easy it is to wipe down. With little ones, spills and smudges are inevitable, but the bin’s sleek design makes cleaning quick and simple. The odour-absorbing pod pack that comes with the bin is a lifesaver, keeping any unpleasant smells at bay and ensuring the kitchen stays fresh.\n\nThe soft-closing lid is another great addition. No more loud bangs when the kids (or my husband) close the bin. The 10 included custom-fit bags are of excellent quality, and the handy liner pocket at the back means we will never run out.\n\nIt also comes with a 10-year warranty which offers peace of mind and durability to offset the initial expense. Overall I really love this bin, it is well thought out and practical for family life.', 'I had been using a very small bin in my kitchen for a while, so I made the upgrade to this and I am not disappointed. The size is perfect, it’s not too big or too small which is great seeing as it’s a dual bin. The silver is nice and matches my kitchen appliances well. The functionality of the bin is brilliant - I love being able to fully remove the recycling compartment, having the bin bags in an accessible position and the little pocket to keep the bags in at the back. It’s such a great addition to my kitchen and I highly recommend it!', 'The bin is not cheap, but it is well worth the investment.\nIt feels very sturdy and well-crafted, aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and just the right size.\nIt is spacious, yet not excessively large like having two separate bins for recycling and landfill. Moreover, it is visually more appealing than having two bins. Cleaning it is also a breeze - the fingerprint-resistant coating is effective, and any spills or drips wipe off effortlessly.\nThis bin comes with 10 bags and an odor-absorbing pod pack. The bags are excellent and can be conveniently placed in the liner pocket at the back of the bin. The replacement liners are slightly pricey but worth it.\nAlso the warranty period of 10 years is a significant advantage of this product.\nI highly recommend this!', 'This bin is the nicest looking bin I ever owned and it is also very well made and solid. I absolutely love the two separate parts this bin comes with. One part for everyday household waste and the other part for recycling with plastic bucket.\nThis bin comes with 10 bags and with odorsorb pod pack. The bags are great and can be placed to the liner pocket at the back of the bin which is very practical. The replacement liners are a little pricy but we’ll worth it. \nEasy to clean and to keep clean. \nUnfortunately the odorsorb is not great and the lid doesn’t not open fully which makes it harder to remove the bucket.\nI absolutely love this bin and highly recommend this item!', ""I'm really impressed with the Simplehuman 58L Bin. The double bin feature makes waste separation easy, and the sturdy pedal and single top opening make it user-friendly. Its sleek appearance, fingerprint-resistant coating, and thoughtful design details like built-in liner storage and a soft-close lid add to its appeal. Overall, it's durable, functional, and stylish—definitely a bin I'd recommend."", 'I absolutely love this bin! This is the first time I’ve had a bin that cannot be knocked over or accessed by my cats/dog so a huge bonus!\nThe outer design of the bin is very modern and I love the rounded edges and brushed silver finish, it looks very sleek and also easy to keep clean. \nThe inside of the bin contains 2 separate compartments which are accessed through a single foot pedal and opens both sides at the same time which makes its super easy to use - one side is for general waste and the other for recycling. The recycling part has a blue bin which can easily be removed for emptying and the other side has an inbuilt section where the bin bags are also stored, genius! The bags can be reordered through the Simple Human website and there is a QR code provided making the ordering easy. The bin also comes with a bin fresh pod which keeps the bin fresh for up to 45 days. The pod itself smells amazing with aromas of citrus. A word of warning, when peeling the backing off the attachment the pod fits into, just be careful it doesn’t peel off the sticky side too as happened to me as this will prevent it being stuck inside the bin - I had to be creative in order to reattach mine!\nWhen changing the bag, the inside edge lifts up so the bag can removed or the recycling bin lifted out and once changed or emptied, the inside edge lowers down securing the bag, whilst also covering the bag from the outside so you don’t see the bag at all once closed. \nOverall, a really smart, well made bin with ‘simple’ features keeping the bin easy to use whilst providing a great way to dispose of rubbish and recycling.', 'Great dual bin with trash and recycle compartments. It’s not big enough for my recycling stuff but it fits my space. Carefully designed and made to suit its purposes. Easy to clean and empty.

Two compartments one for recycling with a lift out bucket. Comes with a air freshener pod to attach to the inside of the lid and can order replacements. Two areas for storing bin bags, soft close lid and long peddle to open as far as bins go its the best!', 'This bin is absolutely perfect! The 2 separate compartments one for recycling & the other for waste is genius ! The recycling side has a removable plastic container that makes emptying it easy . The waste side has an area to store the bin liners. \nVery stylish & sleek design, every kitchen needs this bin . Highly recommend', '58litre Simple Human Bin. First impression’s were it is well made, using good quality materials. The bin is a comfortable height for most people, it isn’t too wide either. l like the single foot pedal which opens a single lid giving access top both bin compartments making it easy too separate the waste. I like both general waste and recycling waste being the same size, the pull out inner bin makes emptying the recycle material easy. Whilst the general waste is held conveniently in bags, l like the bag chute storage for the bags means they are always on hand and you can see when you are running low.  Bins are always going too smell especially in the summer, the odour pod is a nice touch although 45days means they would need to replaced quite often £30 for 8 makes them expensive and more likely to be forgotten in the future.   As bins go it is quite attractive the brushed stainless steel makes it easy too maintain. 10 year guarantee too!', 'Absolutely brilliant bin! I thought it would be overrated but it’s perfect. The size of it is great and would suit any sized kitchen. The recycling side is great to keep the worktops clear and is distinct, stopping little ones putting things in the wrong side. The bin side is fantastic as it comes with perfectly fitted bin bags, making it easy to change and stops any sagging. They are easy to access when you change the bag and it has a replaceable air freshener built in. The refills are quite pricey, but I think generic ones would work. Would recommend!', 'Love this bin, it’s very simple and yet perfectly effective. I love the slow close lid, and also how you can neatly keep the bin liners stored inside the unit which is so convenient. It also came with some free bin liners and a deodoriser which were great little extras.', 'High quality stainless steel bin that looks chic in my kitchen. Whilst modern looking, it’s sturdy enough that neither of my dogs have been able to either open or tip it over to get to its contents. The pedal is quite robust and takes a good push to get the lid open. Easy to lift out recycling compartment makes a convenient job of organising what goes in the main bins. Both the general and recycling bin sections are of ideal size. There is a handy compartment at the back of this bin to store the bin liners which then can be accessed from the inside when you remove the filled bag which I thought was a clever touch. Zero noise when the lid closes although my only gripe is that the lid takes a while to fully close on its own and I find my self giving it a gentle push before walking away to ensure small children or dogs don’t get into it. \nEasy to wipe down and hasn’t lost its shine in the process.', ""This pedal bin is not just brilliant at doing simple things really well, it also looks stunning in your room as well!  With a total capacity of 58litre which is a good size for a family household.  24litres of space on the left side, the handle attached is really useful and makes it easy to lift out and carry.  On the right 34litres.  It's quite large being 56cm wide and 36cm deep and 65.5cm high.  \n\nI love the modern Stainless steel finish of the main body and can't fault the invisible coating which prevents unsightly fingerprints - it really doesn't mark - add to this it also deters germs, very impressive!  \nThe build quality is incredible, everything feels solid and built to last and it's backed up by a 10 year guarantee.   \n\nThe pedal system is steel and spans end to end, with the pedals bug enough to feel robust but neat and sleek enough to add to this bins style.  \n\nThe action in the pedal and the soft close is perfect and again can feel the quality.  \n\nThe inner bin compartments are also very solid with one removable with a built in handle, the bag for each is secured under a sturdy rim that clamps down securely and discreetly around the bag.  \n\nA neat feature is the spare bags are stored in a separate hidden pocket behind the right bin, so they are easy to swap for a new one.  It also comes with a deodoriser that is stuck to the bin and can be replaced with new cartridges, lovely smell!  \n\nIt's not often you will be happy to have your bin on display but this one from SimpleHuman is one not to hide away, it will look beautiful in any kitchen."", 'Perfect bin for the multitude of bags the local council have given us for all different types of recycling! \n\nThis bin is perfect for us. It fits nicely into my small kitchen cupboard and is very easy to use. \n\nThe pedal at the base of the bin is easy to operate when pushing down with your foot to open the lid. \n\nOnce opened, you have two different compartments. One has a handy removable, blue plastic bin insert with a metal handle which I’ll be using for our paper and cardboard recycling.\n\nThe other compartment has access to the bin liner bags (which you get 10 of with the bin). You can feed the bag liners through the back of the bin so when one liner is full, you just remove the full liner, and then you can dispense a new liner - very handy!\n\nThe bin also came with an ‘odour pod’ which can be stuck to the inside lid of the bin to reduce odours.\n\nOverall, I’m very happy with this bin. It’s great quality, a great size and super easy to use.', 'This is a premium product. Firstly, the packaging is really good and the feel of the product indicates that it has been made to a very high standard.\n\nIt’s a huge bin with two compartments totalling 58Litres. The first is for rubbish while the other is for recycling. \n\nIt comes with a pack of complimentary custom fit bin liners and an odour absorb pod (very thoughtful). The bin liners are around 30 to 35 litres in size. And it has a liner pocket from where you can dispense the bin liners easily. The odour absorb pod can last for up to 45 days! This is a ideal during the summer months.\n\nAdditionally, the invisible silver-ion coating on the stainless steel prevents fingerprint marks and the spread of germs without dulling the natural shine of the stainless steel. Excellent!\n\nOverall, I would recommend this product as it stands out amongst other bins. It’s simply excellent!', 'Very stylish and spacious bin, it looks great in my kitchen. \nIt has a very solid and sturdy build, it’s very good quality and feels like it will last a very long time. \nThe soft close function is great and very quiet. \nI love the part that sits on top of the bins, it means you can’t see the top of the bin bags so it looks a lot neater and keeps the bin liners in place brilliantly. \nI really like the handy little bin bag storage in the back, great feature!  \nThe bins are a great size and will take a large volume of rubbish. \nVery happy with my new bin :)', 'When it arrived the box was massive and heavy \nOnce out of the packing it was a good size\n2 separate bins in one recycle / waste \nRecycle has a removable inner bin \nWaste has liners which dispense from within the bin \nVery nice looking bin']"

I liked the design & colours. Alas. Despise being great quality it has a propensity to be too heavy re the design & easily topples over when knocked. Quite frustrating actually. \r\nThe other issue I’ve found is the inner connector to hold bin bags down isn’t very sturdy & pops out a lot. \r\n\r\nA good feature, however, is the fact the lid folds fully back, so is out of the way. Also a decent-sized compact little bin for my use but I think there are better options out there for the money tbh.', 'Used it to replace old bin on caravan door', 'Nice small bin. Attached to the cupboard in the kitchen. Fits perfect. Easy to use and good quality.', 'Sick of metal bins that rust in the bathroom.

I had to reorder again, but worth the wait as it was just what  I needed"", 'Excellent quality, good, sturdy little bin. I use as a bathroom bin, which works well due to it being plastic - much better than the metal ones I used which rusted quickly.

Its good quality & easy to clean, good size. Happy with my purchase.', 'These bins are great, they can be stacked on each other for space saving or attached to a wall.  They are easy to clean and easy to empty with a grab handle.  I use this size for my non recyclable bin and I stack the smaller one on top for my recycling but you could use the smaller one for food if needed.  They come with stickers to show what the bin is being used for.', 'Absolutely LOVE this bin. It’s very compacted, fits nicely in small spaces and it holds loads and to look at you would think so. Light weight and easy to use lid for little kids. Great recycling bin that is also made of recycled products', 'I love the design of this bin. Streamline, so fits easily even in narrow gaps & even comes with a bracket for wall mounting if needed. It is very modern looking. The classic grey shades means it fits with all decors & it feels very robust. The bag retainer ring thing (sorry don’t know the name) is useful & ensures the bin liner remains in place & the top edges clean so tying the bag up is easy & mess free. It also has a carry handle so if choosing not to use liners you can easily take the bins out. The fact these can be bought in different sizes & shapes that easily stack on top of each other is a massive plus especially of space is limited. Being 30ltrs means it offers very good space for a couple or small household. The lid does lift & stay in place although the opening is a little limited for larger items, which can be a nuisance if you have them stacked as you have to remove them & take the lid of to place your item. That said It is only a minor inconvenience & I would definitely recommend this bin.', 'These bins are nice. Small and compact which I like as there’s mostly only me and my daughter at home. The bigger bins for us takes ages to fill but I like to empty them so they don’t smell so I love that they’re smaller. I like the little recycling bin too. Comes with stickers so you can add pictures if you wanted to. I like that they have handles too. Only thing I would have liked is the lids to be abit bigger when opened but otherwise, they’re great. I like the colour too.']"

Come’s with a 10 year warranty, so the simple human bins are built to last.\nVery handy that the bin comes with a pack of liners that fits into the dispenser inside of the bin to get you started. Good quality liners that come with a code to help with ordering extra liners. Helpful that liners can be ordered from Argos too.\nThere is also an odorsorb pod included that fits into the lid to keep your bin smelling fresh for up to 45 days, this was brilliant I thought, no more  lingering smells.\nNice wide foot pedal to open the bin easily and a soft close lid.\nAll in all a nice addition to the kitchen, well made and all the little extras make it very practical to use.', 'Im so impressed with this bin. I was quite sceptic about the size at first because of having an 80 litre bin previously but in fact its more than enough for a family of four adults and a dog. Aesthetically it is very appealing and modern. The fact that it came with a free trial 10 pack of strong bin liners and a trial perfume pod was a bonus. I love that theres a compartment for the bin liners to be stored to make simple work of changing bags. The pedal to open the bin is quite long so less chance of wear in one place and very stirdy.

Not only is it extremely stylish, it solves every problem that has frustrated me with every other bin I've had:\n\n• I don't need to go searching for bin liners as the Simplehuman liner packs sit in a recess at the back of the bin and when you need to replace the liner, you just pull one from the pack through the slot situated on the inside of the bin and position it in place.\n\n• No more unsightly tops of bin liners showing as the top of the liner is hidden, and securely held in place, under the deep rim that runs around the top of the bin.\n\n• Odours are eliminated thanks to the Odorsorb pod. Just attach the self adhesive pod holder to the inside of the lid, then remove the backing from the pod and slide it into place.\n\nThe bin has a brushed steel look finish and has a silver-ion coating which means it doesn't show finger marks and helps reduce the spread of germs. It looks really stylish and good quality. I like that this has good capacity yet has a relatively neat footprint. It is sturdy but isn't too heavy.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find a pack of liners and an Odorsorb pod were included, so you're ready to go immediately after taking it out of the box and can experience the full Simplehuman problem solving expertise. The liners are much thicker than my usual ones so I don't need to worry about them splitting and leaking. The pod has a nice citrusy scent which helps the bin to smell fresh.\n\nThe bin has been really well designed so the foot pedal means you can open the bin without touching it with your hands.

The bin is really quite with the soft close, no more banging every 2mins when the kids are putting something in it. It is really easy to clean with just a wipe down. The coating on the bin doesn't leave prints but the pedal itself doesn't have a coating and my 2 kids are always bare footed leaving toe prints on it, meaning we are forever down cleaning it. The bag holder at the back is cool and so convenient to just pull a bag out. The neutraliser tab smelled of lemon before i fitted it but still to smell it since. Yes i would recommend this bin for style, the amount it holds and for the soft close, but if you hate toe prints from kids, you will be forever cleaning them off."", 'This rectangular bin looks the part in my kitchen.

I love the handy liner storage and you get a pack to start you off as well as an odorsorb pod for inside the lid to hide those stinky smells, which is refillable. It’s great how the design hides the bag from showing too. Easy to wipe clean, germ and fingerprint resistant , great smooth pedal action, soft close lid with wide opening so less mess.  The liners are extra thick and a good strength so less chance of leakage. Simple human is pricier than other brands but they are definitely built to last.  Would definitely, highly recommend.', 'The perfect sized bin for a four person household without taking over the kitchen and being overwhelming. The pedal/lid operation is so smooth, and shows its quality. It operates smoothly and slowly no matter how firmly you press the pedal which conveniently stretches almost the full width of the bin. Two features which I have not come across before, which really enhance the design are the odour killing pod holder that fits in the lid, and the sack holder. Now this sack holder is a game changer, it holds a replacement bag of 20 bin bags in the rear of the bin, so when you come to replace the sack, you just reach inside and grab your fresh sack, no searching in the cupboard under the sink in the hope you have a new bin bag. When fitted, the sacks overhang the bin, which in turn is hidden by another section, so no unsightly bin bags overlapping the bin. Fingerprint free stainless steel complete the look. In summary a great looking bin that holds just the right amount and works as it should. Looks good, feels good to use, and appears to be built to last.', ""This bin is so much better than I first thought. It's sturdy, elegant and very stylish. The bin is so easy to use. The air freshner inside is genius!!! Its also very easy to empty too.

Even easier to set up as the only thing you have to do is put the bin liner in place (the liner is cleverly hidden by a liner shield inside the bin which makes the bin very clean and sharp looking) and add the odorsorb pod. The pod is attached inside the lid and provides a very pleasant, but not overpowering, fragrance. I like scent very much and have already looked on the website to see how to order more, which I will most definitely do. I have also looked on the website for replacement bin liners, which although more expensive than the liners I have previously bought I will purchase as they fit snugly and are easy to remove simply by pulling out of the bin by the draw handles.\nThe pedal to open the bin is smooth and it is easy to place the rubbish in the bin without touching the bin. The soft close of the lid Is gentle and extremely quiet - which is a plus as who wants to hear the bin lid clanking shut.\nI am impressed by the liner storage within the bin, which makes replacing the bin liner a quick and easy job as I do not have to go in a cupboard to get the liner and then return the roll back.\nThe bin is very sturdy (but not overly heavy) and has a nice “built in handle” at the back should you need to move the bin for any reason.\nThe lid fits well and so far the bin has not shown and finger marks but just looks smart in the kitchen.\nAll in all a bin I would not hesitate to recommend, it is stylish, practical, has a smooth, silent action and helps with odour by having the odorsorb pod which will be especially helpful in the warmer months of the year.', 'I love this bin a simple but effective design! My favourite part is the internal liner store meaning you don’t need to find a home for the liners and as you change the liner you get a sense of if you’re running low! The bin comes with a guide and a QR code of which liners fit your bin so you can easily order more.  The liners fit perfectly and better than any bin I’ve had before.. they’re secured by a piece that sits over them stopping them slipping into the bin! The pedal is easily used to open the bin with a light touch and goes across the whole bottom of the bin making it much easier to open! It’s soft close meaning it doesn’t bang either! As for removal of the liner it’s super easy and I’m convinced that this is due to the shape of the bin as the liner doesn’t become a vacuum when removing it! Best bin I’ve ever had!', ""What can I say about this bin other than stylish, slick and stunning. Perfect addition to the kitchen, amazing for foot pedal for easy of opening and what's even better is the soft closing lid. Easy to clean with the stainless steel base. The bin bags hide nicely in the rim of the lid. There is a great feature for extra bags which smartly fit in the cubby at the back of the bin."", ""I thought reviewing a bin would be difficult but this bin is amazing. As I unboxed it I was struck by the quality of the product and the care that's gone into the design. The finish is a nice matt silver that looks great and, per the specs, doesn't seem to attract fingerprints. It took me a few seconds to work out where to stick the odour pod (it slots into a holder that sticks to the inside of the lid) and in the first few days it coped well with the remnants of a baked camembert cheese.\n\nThe holder for the liners is a neat idea as without a liner you simply pull one from the caddy on the inside of the bin. Open a new pouch of liners and slot it into the holder and your liners are easy to find when needed - no more hunting under the sink. It may be difficult to work out when it's time to order new liners and I wonder if there's a reminder of some kind like a card when the last few bags are pulled out (if not it might be something they could add if it's not already present).\n\nThe liners fit perfectly and are secured really well by the top lid. The pedal action is smooth and raises the lid quickly and when released the lid drops slowly and quietly. To empty it press the pedal, lift the liner securing lip, grab the liner handles and lift. The bag closes up as it lifts out of the bin so no risk of rubbish spilling and the liners seem very strong. Replacement packs of liners may be more expensive than supermarket own brands but I will buy their own liner packs as they are a perfect fit and easy to install and remove. The odour pads are probably a nice option but again I think I'll keep using them as they work really well. \n\nI really like this product and I'm considering getting a smaller one for the bathroom as the 45 litre version is quite large. This is a very high quality product and I think will last for a long time. It looks nice, works well, and has useful features that (until you have used this bin) you might not realise are good to have.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending this product."", 'As a busy household, I need a bin that is practical and doesn’t retain finger marks and this does exactly that. It has smart technology which means finger prints aren’t left behind and the soft open and closer helps reduce that painful familiar bin slam. There is a holder at the back which is used for storing bin liners, as well as an easy pull through to make touching full bins a little more satisfying and disgusting. Ideal for small households too.', 'I have just received my SimplyHuman Liner Pocket Pedal Bin; Brushed Stainless Steel and I can say that I am very impressed with its quality, durability and style. I previously had a mid-range bin, which cost half of the price of this product with an auto opening setting, but I constantly had to keep spending money buying batteries which isn’t sustainable in the long term and not cost effective, without even considering the environmental impact. I love the pedal feature as I don’t need to touch the lid when loading the bin and I no longer need the auto opening function, due to it’s pedal. If you have the spare cash, this product is great, it has a great capacity for a medium to big family household. That mean you won’t have to keep changing the liners, in which my household never enjoys to do. It comes with an anti-odour technology which will reduce any smell and its durability will make this bin last for the many years to come. There is a build in bin liner dispenser which is nice, but you have to buy the branded SimplyHuman packs for it. It’s not that expensive long term, as due to the bin high-capacity, you won’t need to constantly change it. No more spending money with batteries, no more changing the liner 3 times per week and no smellier bin in my house. Everyone always says, buy cheap, buy twice, so why not expend a bit more and have something that will last all those years.', 'This is a great looking bin in my kitchen. It’s a good size and height for ease of use. The soft close function works very smoothly. The step for the lid doesn’t require much pressure to lift the lid. One of my favourite qualities of the bin is the bin liner pocket at the back, which you can access from the inside to replace the liner. The brushed stainless steel exterior is germ and fingerprint resistant, so it’s been great to use, especially when my children use it with greasy hands and therefore leaves no marks. Also, the bin liners are very strong and sturdy, which is perfect, as I have previously have had to use two bin liners in order to withstand and hold the rubbish. I cannot recommend this bin enough! Definitely deserves 5 stars.']"

I wanted an integrated double but just not got the spare unit so this is perfect. I thought 30litres was going to be to small but it’s actually ok!!!

This has replaced them and looks so much better.  It also functions well and having just one lid to open for both compartments has proved to be an unexpected and time-saving bonus.  I highly recommend this model.  The only improvement I can think of is to have one large and one smaller bin in the same unit, as I have more recyclable than non-recyclable material to dispose of.', 'I love my bin.

Comes with a bag dispenser which you can just pull from the pack of bags at the back of the bin. Very easy and great design by Simplehuman. \n\nOverall a great looking product that is very practical in the modern kitchen.', 'I’m really pleased with this Simplehuman black step bin. At 45L it’s a good size for use in the kitchen and looks smart and stylish. The black plastic is good quality and easy to keep clean. The pedal mechanism is easy to use and the lid has a soft close function when you take your foot off, so the lid doesn’t slam down. I particularly like the liner pocket at the back of the bin. This allows you to store a pack of K size bin bag liners (a trial pack is included) within the bin itself. When a new bag is needed simply pull a liner out from inside the bin and once fitted the stainless steel rim slots back over to hide the top of the liner from sight. Added to that this bin comes with a 5 year warranty for peace of mind.', 'Really sturdy bin that looks really stylish in the kitchen. I love the bin bag dispenser which is a great storage solution & provides easy access. No internal bucket which my last bin had & was sometimes awkward when emptying.

The bin bag holder on the back isn't anything special, I'd rather have more bin/waste area, than take up storage for the bags. I also don't see the point in paying a premium for a bin bag. It slips to one side after using the foot pedal a few times, which is a little annoying. I really wanted this to be absolutely spectacular, due to its price tag, but I'm just not won over by it. The soft close mechanism is sturdy, my 3 year old has tested that many times and it still works."", ""Really Cool stylist looking pedal bin . Easy to use, great smooth as you like pedal for opening bin lid  hands free, really quiet i love it !

Inner pocket stores and dispenses liners great feature .Inner rim secures and hides liners from sight .My Bin has defeated my dog , never thought I'd find a bin that would ."", 'This has proven to be a great sized, practical bin for our kitchen. It slots into a corner of the room very neatly, without the wasted space you get with a circular bin. It opens and closes very smoothly, with a soft close mechanism so you’re not constantly hearing it slam back shut. The bin fits a lot in and the spare bags are helpfully stored into a pocket in the back for easy access. I think the black colour looks very premium although it does show dust quite quickly. Overall, I think it should last us well, the bin itself seems high quality alongside the bags that it comes with.', ""# The build quality is top notch feels expensive.\n# Nice paddle bin with slot to keep bin liners. \n# The shape is a different from usual bin which are either square or rectangle throughout this one     narrows down as we move towards the base of the bin.\n# There's a bin liner storage which can be accessed from inside and outside suite handy when you're     putting new bin liners from outside and when you need to replace existing bin liner after you've     packed editing one just pull a new bin liner from within the bin."", 'At first I was expecting some high tec bit of equipment and was a bit disappointed that it is really just a bin! It has a soft closing lid, and a pocket inside the bin for the new bin liners. Apart from that it’s fairly standard. The bin liner pocket is ok if you intend to buy the prescribed liners in a box but your supermarket ones on a roll won’t fit in the dispenser so over time this expensive feature will probably be redundant. There’s nothing wrong with it but it’s very expensive for a bin. A bit over engineered for what it needs to be. On the plus side I think the foot bar is great, nice and wide, across the bottom and easy to step on rather than trying to find a little pedal. And it does look sturdy and well made and not wobbly or flimsy. Great size and there even bigger ones to be had but you’d need a large space for them. Has a five year guarantee, which I’m keeping safe as that will help to justify the cost.', 'I’ve had a Simplehuman bin in my kitchen for approx 9 years but this new bin is definitely a big upgrade. It’s 45 litres and is a rectangle shape so holds a decent amount of rubbish. We’re a family of 4 and the bin bag didn’t need changing for 5 days which is impressive. The bin comes with a bag of Simplehuman bin bags size K and they fit perfectly. You can store the big bags in a holder at the back of the bin and then pull the bags into the bin when it needs changing. Definitely a good option especially when my husband is changing the binbag. The new ones are literally right there! The bin is plastic and the pedal is steel and feels very robust. The lid closes silently and fits nicely in my kitchen. Highly recommend.', 'We have been after a large family bin for quite some time and we’ve have some of the major brands before, but this bin is a lot different to the rest. From the soft closing design, to the ease of use of the foot pedal this great looking bin is the one to have in your house! It has a neat liner pocket which stores a pack of 20 pack of custom fit liners, and it dispenses quickly and efficiently for a quick liner change, and has a neat and secure stainless steel liner rim that flips up for a seamless liner change which keeps the liner hidden from sight. The steel pedal is designed to last over 150000 steps, which is more than 20 steps a day for the next 20 years!!', ""This bin was a bit larger than expected, with a 47cm width, it was a bit too big for my small kitchen, but the build was very good quality, and looked great, the soft close lid was nice , and the manual foot pedal was a bit of a phaff, after using a previous touch  and open lid , but I'm sure you would get used to it , the inside bag dispenser is a good idea , although the bags that fit inside the dispenser are a lot more expensive than unbranded bags but the quality of the bags are very good, the size was an issue for me but for someone with a larger kitchen this would be ideal,"", 'Great bin, this bin was smaller than expected in hight but its wide which is great, the design of the bin is sturdy and sleek and very easy to clean, the storage hole that fits and hides the liners is a really great idea and saves rummaging round your cupboards for the bags in bin change.\nOnly downside I would say is if the lid was soft close would make this bin even better, ours doesn’t seem to be and just bangs down.\nOther than that I’m very happy', ""This bin is very stylish looking and looks amazing in my kitchen. The pedestal is lovely and chunky very easy to press.

Easy to change the bag and bin is lightweight. Lid can be taken off for ease of cleaning. Only downside is the refill bags are quite expensive, so will probably go back to using normal bin bags.', ""I've been using this bin for about 2 weeks now and I can definitely say this is one of the best kitchen bins I have ever bought, it is nice and sturdy, built to a high level of quality, the lid is soft closing, the bin pedal is hard metal-heavy-duty so you know it's going to last, there is no shaking or twisting of the bin body or lid when you open the lid, also you can store the new bin bags in the rear of the inside of the bin, which makes it an easy process to change out bin bags. Overall this is an excellent bin, built to high quality and standards. I would definitely recommend this product."", 'Taking the 45L rectangular pedal bin out the box the first thing you notice is the weight demonstrating the quality material. The black plastic and metal combination compliments each other and looks and feels fantastic. It is aesthetically pleasing against the oven of the same colour. The custom fit bin liners provided by simplehuman fit perfectly therefore snug in the bin. It’s easy to fit the liner without having to move any parts but just lifting the lid. The pedal mechanism is smooth to open the bin lid and closes softly without any sound. Lifting the full liner you can see the strength in the bag as you carry it to the outside bin. No chance of bursting.', ""Stylish bin easy to get out of the box. \nIn the back of the bin is a space to store simply human bin liners and you can get them from the inside and refill from the back.\nThey have supplied one pack free to try.

Discovered this, available at the local Argos, and it\'s a great size to fit onto the counter. Love being able to wash the inner tub. Much more hygienic in my view.', 'It’s well made nice looking and sturdy but has quite limited capacity and it is hard to remove the inner grey bin when emptying it\r\nI wish I had bought something bigger', ""Like the caddy. Good seal. Reasonable capacity. But the bags that come with it don't hold liquids well."", ""The caddy is small but then with bigger ones they would get smelly by the time they were full, at least this one forces us to change it regularly and not have it smelling. Because of its size it fits neatly under cupboard. The only thing I would say is getting the grey inside container out is not the easiest and most intuitive process and for that reason I have deducted a star but once you know how to do it with 2 fingers pushing it out then it's easier, still not as smooth as you would hope."", 'bought this for my mothering law to replace an old one she is absolutely delighted.', 'This is an excellent little compost caddy, very smart & a perfect size to sit near the sink to hold all your fruit & vegetable waste before adding to your garden compost bin. The detachable insert comes out easily for washing.', 'Just what we were looking for. Neat and tidy looking to sit on the counter top, easy to dismantle and clean and a good size. We like how the compost bags are hidden inside and how the lid comes off for cleaning. It seems robust enough to last. A great product at a good price.', 'Very well made quality product. I needed a small waste bin for my en_suite  and although this is really a food waste caddy the principal is the same and being an ""on trend"" colour of grey / white it was perfect for my room.', 'Leave this in utility room so can load up with recyclable food waste - lid shuts to keep smells away !', 'The caddy is a nice style and size. Easy to clean.', 'Brilliant! Well made. Looks good on the kitchen worktop. Much better looking than the council dark brown food caddy. Roll of caddy bags an added bonus. Good value for money. Would recommend.', 'Composting can be cute! This food caddy is great...fits anywhere & comes apart for thorough cleaning. Highly recommend :)', 'It good, however the plastic bags dont fix properly. But will recommend it for a started.', 'Not big enough tiny.\r\nThe image shows it looking like a decent size but holds hardly anything.', 'I felt compelled to leave a review after the amazing experience i had, the service was fast and efficient. it probably only took 2mins to get seen. To top it off i received excellent service from Mubeena.', 'Not too big, but not too small. \r\nLooks elegant. \r\nEasy to wash \r\nJust right for a small family', ""Great size, looks good - I'm going to get another one as a spare"", 'We would have preferred it to have been a bit bigger but it does the job we bought it for perfectly.', 'very pleased with compost collecter.', 'Great caddy for food.', 'It comes with the caddy liners.. great..!', 'nice to be able to  start   home composting, good price as well.', ""Would recommend it's the second one bought"", 'Bought this for use on the kitchen counter top.  Perfect size for veg peelings, tea bags etc.  \r\n\r\nGoes in the dishwasher to clean.\r\n\r\nRecommended.', 'This is a neat small caddy, that fits lots in.\r\nVery pleased as it keeps food waste and green bag of the worktops and out of sight .', 'Good compact food waste bin. Fits under sink unit. Easy to keep clean', 'This is great makes it easy to use the green bags as they don’t stay open it keeps everything clean and traps food smells until it’s ready to be emptied', 'Easy to open. Glad to have some bags go with it', ""I bought this as a replacement for the small food waste bins given to us by the council and I'm so glad I did. It came with some little green bags and the inside part lifts out so you can tuck the bin bags in and they don't constantly fall down into the bin. So much better!"", 'No bags supplied with my bin', 'Looks. Good and very useful', 'This item is far more charming than others in the market at a reasonable price.']"
